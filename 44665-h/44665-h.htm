<h2>Things A Boy Should Know About
Electricity</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>ABOUT FRICTIONAL ELECTRICITY.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_1"></a>1. Some Simple Experiments.</b> Have you ever
shuffled your feet along over the carpet on a winter's
evening and then quickly touched your finger to the
nose of an unsuspecting friend? Did
he jump when a bright spark leaped
from your finger and struck him fairly
on the very tip of his sensitive nasal
organ?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 184px;">
<img src="images/i_007.png" width="184" height="342" alt="black cat" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 1.</div>
</div>

<p>Did you ever succeed in proving to
the pussy-cat, Fig. 1, that something
unusual occurs when you thoroughly
rub his warm fur with your hand? Did
you notice the bright sparks that passed
to your hand when it was held just above
the cat's back? You should be able to
see, hear, and feel these sparks, especially when the air
is dry and you are in a dark room.</p>

<p>Did you ever heat a piece of paper before the fire until
it was real hot, then lay it upon the table and rub it from
end to end with your hand, and finally see it cling to the
wall?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Were you ever in a factory where there were large
belts running rapidly over pulleys or wheels, and where
large sparks would jump to your hands when held near
the belts?</p>

<p>If you have never performed any of the four experiments
mentioned, you should try them the first time a
chance occurs. There are dozens of simple, fascinating
experiments that may be performed with this kind of
electricity.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_2"></a>2. Name.</b> As this variety of electricity is made, or
generated, by the friction of substances upon each other,
it is called <i>frictional</i> electricity. It is also called <i>static</i>
electricity, because it generally stands still upon the surface
of bodies and does not "flow in currents" as easily
as some of the other varieties. Static electricity may be
produced by induction
as well as by friction.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/i_008.png" width="406" height="378" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 2.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_3"></a>3. History.</b> It has
been known for over
2,000 years that certain
substances act queerly
when rubbed. Amber
was the first substance
upon which electricity
was produced by friction,
and as the Greek
name for amber is
<i>elektron</i>, bodies so affected were said to be <i>electrified</i>.
When a body, like ebonite, is rubbed with a flannel
cloth, we say that it becomes <i>charged with electricity</i>.
Just what happens to the ebonite is not clearly understood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
We know, however, that it will attract light
bodies, and then quickly repel them if they be conductors.
Fig. 2 shows a piece of tissue-paper jumping toward a
sheet of ebonite that has been electrified with a flannel
cloth.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 237px;">
<img src="images/i_009.png" width="237" height="326" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 3.</div>
</div>
<p><b><a id="par_4"></a>4. Conductors and Non-Conductors.</b> Electricity
can be produced upon glass and ebonite because they do
not carry or conduct it away. If a piece of iron be
rubbed, the electricity passes from the iron into the
earth as fast as it is generated, because the iron is a <i>conductor</i>
of electricity. Glass is an <i>insulator</i> or <i>non-conductor</i>.
Frictional electricity resides upon the outside,
only, of conductors. A hollow tin box
will hold as great a charge as a solid
piece of metal having the same outside
size and shape. When frictional
electricity passes from one place to
another, sparks are produced. Lightning
is caused by the passage of
static electricity from a cloud to the
earth, or from one cloud to another.
In this case air forms the conductor.
(For experiments, see "Study,"
Chapter VII.)</p>



<p><b><a id="par_5"></a>5. Electroscopes.</b> A piece of carbon, pith, or even
a small piece of damp tissue-paper will serve as an electroscope
to test the presence of static electricity. The pith
is usually tied to a piece of silk thread which is a non-conductor.
Fig. 3 shows the ordinary form of <i>pith-ball
electroscope</i>.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 308px;">
<img src="images/i_010.png" width="308" height="476" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 4.</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>leaf electroscope</i> is a very delicate apparatus. Gold-leaf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
is generally used, but aluminum-leaf will stand
handling and will do for all ordinary purposes. Fig. 4
shows a common form, the glass being used to keep
currents of air from the leaves and at the same time to
insulate them from the earth.</p>

<p>Electroscopes are used to show the presence, relative
amount, or kind of static
electricity on a body.
(See "Study," Chapter
XI.)</p>


<p><b><a id="par_6"></a>6. Two Kinds of
Electrification.</b> It can
be shown that the electrification
produced on all
bodies by friction is not
the same; for example,
that generated with glass
and silk is not the same
as that made with ebonite
and flannel. It has been
agreed to call that produced
by glass and silk
<i>positive</i>, and that by
ebonite and flannel <i>negative</i>.
The signs + and - are used for positive and
negative.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_7"></a>7. Laws of Electrification.</b> (1) Charges of the
same kind repel each other; (2) charges of unlike kinds
attract each other; (3) either kind of a charge attracts
and is attracted by a neutral body.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_8"></a>8. Static Electric Machines.</b> In order to produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
static electricity in quantities for experiments, some
device is necessary.</p>

<p>The <i>electrophorus</i> (e-lec-troph´-o-rus) is about the simplest
form of machine. Fig. 5 shows a simple electrophorus
in which are two insulators and one conductor.
The ebonite sheet E S is used with a flannel cloth to generate
the electricity. The metal cover E C is lifted by the
insulating handle E R. The cover E C is placed upon
the thoroughly charged sheet E S, and then it is touched
for an instant with the finger, before lifting it by E R.
The charge upon E C can then be
removed by bringing the hand near
it. The bright spark that passes
from E C to the hand indicates that
E C has discharged itself into the
earth. The action of the electrophorus
depends upon induction. (For
experiments, details of action,
induced electrification, etc., see
"The Study of Elementary Electricity and Magnetism
by Experiment," Chapters VIII. and IX.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 264px;">
<img src="images/i_011.png" width="264" height="265" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 5.</div>
</div>

<p><i>The first electric machine</i> consisted of a ball of sulphur
fastened to a spindle which could be turned by a crank.
By holding the hands or a pad of silk upon the revolving
ball, electricity was produced.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 558px;">
<img src="images/i_012a.jpg" width="558" height="374" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 6.</div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 551px;">
<img src="images/i_012b.jpg" width="551" height="397" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 7.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_9"></a>9. The Cylinder Electric Machine</b> consists, as
shown in Fig. 6, of a glass cylinder so mounted that it
can be turned by a crank. Friction is produced by a
pad of leather C, which presses against the cylinder as it
turns. Electric sparks can be taken from the large "conductors"
which are insulated from the earth. The opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a><br /><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
electricities unite with sparks across D and E. If
use is to be made of the electricity, either the rubber or
the prime conductor must be connected with the ground.
In the former case positive electricity is obtained; in the
latter, negative.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_10"></a>10. The Plate Electrical Machine.</b> Fig. 7 also
shows an old form of machine. Such machines are made
of circular plates of glass or ebonite, two rubbing pads
being usually employed, one on each side of the plate.
One operator is seen on an insulated stool (Fig. 7), the
electricity passing through him before entering the earth
by way of the body of the man at the right.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 565px;">
<img src="images/i_013.jpg" width="565" height="385" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 8.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_11"></a>11. The Toepler-Holtz Machine</b>, in one form, is
shown in Fig. 8. The electricity is produced by the
principle of induction, and not by mere friction. This
machine, used in connection with condensers, produces
large sparks.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 274px;">
<img src="images/i_014a.png" width="274" height="335" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 9.</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="par_12"></a>12. The Wimshurst Machine</b> is of recent date, and
not being easily affected by atmospheric changes, is very
useful for ordinary laboratory work. Fig. 9 shows one
form of this machine.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_13"></a>13. Influence Machines
for Medical Purposes</b> are
made in a large variety of
forms. A Wimshurst machine
is generally used as an exciter
to charge the plates of the
large machine when they lose
their charge on account of
excessive moisture in the
atmosphere. Fig. 10 shows a
large machine.</p>



<p><b><a id="par_14"></a>14. Uses of Electrical
Machines.</b> Static electricity has been used for many
years in the laboratory
for experimental
purposes, for
charging condensers,
for medical purposes,
etc. It is
now being used for
X-ray work, and
considerable advancement
has been
made within a few
years in the construction
and efficiency
of the machines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<img src="images/i_014b.png" width="379" height="355" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 10.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>With the modern machines large sparks are produced
by merely turning a crank, enough electricity being produced
to imitate a small thunderstorm. The sparks of
home-made lightning will jump several inches.</p>

<p>Do not think that electricity is generated in a commercial
way by static electric machines. The practical
uses of static electricity are very few when compared
with those of current electricity from batteries and

<p><b><a id="par_17"></a>17. Electromotive
Force of Static
Electricity.</b> Although
the sparks of
static electricity are
large, the <i>quantity</i> of electricity is very small. It would
take thousands of galvanic cells to produce a spark an
inch long. While the quantity of static electricity is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
small, its potential, or electromotive force (E. M. F.),
is very high. We say that an ordinary gravity cell has
an E. M. F. of a little over one volt. Five such cells
joined in the proper way
would have an E. M. F. of a
little over five volts. You
will understand, then, what
is meant when we say that the
E. M. F. of a lightning flash
is millions of volts.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_18"></a>18. Atmospheric Electricity.</b>
The air is usually
electrified, even in clear
weather, although its cause is
not thoroughly understood.
In 1752 it was proved by
Benjamin Franklin (Fig. 15), with his famous kite
experiment, that atmospheric and frictional electricities
are of the same nature. By means of a kite, the string
being wet by the rain, he succeeded, during a thunderstorm,
in drawing sparks, charging
condensers, etc.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_19"></a>19. Lightning</b> may be produced
by the passage of electricity
between clouds, or between a
cloud and the earth (Fig. 16),
which, with the intervening air,
have the effect of a condenser.
When the attraction between
the two electrifications gets great enough, a spark passes.
When the spark has a zigzag motion it is called <i>chain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
lightning</i>. In hot weather flashes are often seen which
light whole clouds, no thunder being heard. This is
called <i>heat lightning</i>, and is generally considered to be
due to distant discharges,
the light of
which is reflected by
the clouds. The
lightning flash represents
billions of volts.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_20"></a>20. Thunder</b> is
caused by the violent
disturbances produced
in the air by lightning.
Clouds, hills,
etc., produce echoes,
which, with the original
sound, make the
rolling effect.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_21"></a>21. Lightning-Rods</b>,
when well
constructed, often prevent
violent discharges.
Their pointed
prongs at the top
allow the negative
electricity of the earth
to pass quietly into the air to neutralize the positive in
the cloud above. In case of a discharge, or stroke of
lightning, the rods aid in conducting the electricity to
the earth. The ends of the rods are placed deep in the
earth, Fig. 17.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_22"></a>22. St. Elmo's Fire.</b> Electrification from the earth
is often drawn up from the earth through the masts of
ships, Fig. 18, to neutralize that in the clouds, and, as it
escapes from the points of the masts, light is produced.</p>

luminous effects, Fig. 19, often seen in the north. They
often occur at the same time with magnetic storms, when
telegraph and telephone work may be disturbed. The
exact cause of this light is not known, but it is thought
by many to be due to disturbances in the earth's magnetism
caused by the action of the sun.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_24"></a>24. Natural Magnets.</b> Hundreds of years ago it
was discovered that a certain ore of iron, called lodestone,
had the power of picking up small pieces of iron. It was
used to indicate the north and south line, and it was discovered
later that small pieces of steel could be permanently
magnetized by rubbing them upon the lodestone.</p>


<p><b><a id="par_25"></a>25. Artificial Magnets.</b> Pieces of steel, when magnetized,
are called artificial magnets. They are made in
many forms. The electromagnet is also an artificial
magnet; this will be treated separately.</p>


<p><b><a id="par_26"></a>26. The Horseshoe Magnet</b>, Fig. 20, is, however,
the one with which we are the most familiar.
They are always painted red, but the red paint
has nothing to do with the magnetism.</p>

<p>The little end-piece is called the keeper, or
armature; it should always be kept in place
when the magnet is not in use. The magnet
itself is made of steel, while the armature is
made of soft iron. Steel retains magnetism
for a long time, while soft iron loses it almost instantly.
The ends of the magnet are called its <i>poles</i>, and nearly
all the strength of the magnet seems to reside at the
poles, the curved part having no attraction for outside
bodies. One of the poles of the magnet is marked with
a line, or with the letter N. This is called the north
pole of the magnet, the other being its south pole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>



<p><b><a id="par_27"></a>27. Bar Magnets</b> are straight magnets. Fig. 21
shows a round bar magnet. The screw in the end is for
use in the telephone, described later.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_28"></a>28. Compound Magnets.</b> When several thin steel
magnets are riveted together, a compound
magnet is formed. These can be
made with considerable strength. Fig.
22 shows a compound horseshoe magnet.
Fig. 23 shows a form of compound bar
magnet used in telephones. The use of
the coil of wire will be explained later.
A thick piece of steel can not be magnetized
through and through. In the compound
magnet we have the effect of a
thick magnet practically magnetized
through and through.</p>

</div>

<p><b><a id="par_29"></a>29. Magnetic and Diamagnetic
Bodies.</b> Iron, and substances containing
iron, are the ones most readily attracted by a magnet.
Iron is said to be <i>magnetic</i>. Some substances, like
nickel, for example, are visibly attracted by very strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
magnets only. Strange as it may seem, some substances
are actually repelled by strong magnets; these are called
<i>diamagnetic</i> bodies. Brass, copper, zinc, etc., are not
visibly affected by a magnet.
Magnetism will act through
paper, glass, copper, lead,
etc.</p>

</div>

<p><b><a id="par_30"></a>30. Making Magnets.</b>
One of the strangest properties
that a magnet has is its power to give magnetism to
another piece of steel. If a sewing-needle be properly
rubbed upon one of the poles of a magnet, it will become
strongly magnetized
and will retain its magnetism
for years. Strong
permanent magnets are
made with the aid of
electromagnets. Any
number of little magnets
may be made from a horseshoe
magnet without injuring
it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/i_023b.jpg" width="312" height="418" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 25.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_31"></a>31. Magnetic Needles
and Compasses.</b> If a
bar magnet be suspended
by a string, or floated
upon a cork, which can
easily be done with the
magnet made from a sewing-needle, Fig. 24, it will
swing around until its poles point north and south. Such
an arrangement is called a <i>magnetic needle</i>. In the regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<i>compass</i>, a magnetic needle is supported upon a pivot.
Compasses have been used for many centuries by mariners
and others. Fig. 25 shows an ordinary pocket
compass, and Fig. 26 a form of mariner's compass, in
which the small bar magnets are fastened to a card
which floats, the whole being so mounted that it keeps a
horizontal position, even though the vessel rocks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 506px;">
<img src="images/i_024.jpg" width="506" height="428" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 26.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_32"></a>32. Action of Magnets Upon Each Other.</b> By
making two small sewing-needle magnets, you can easily
study the laws of attraction and repulsion. By bringing
the two north poles, or the two south poles, near each
other, a repulsion will be noticed. Unlike poles attract
each other. The attraction between a magnet and iron
is mutual; that is, each attracts the other. Either pole
of a magnet attracts soft iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>In magnetizing a needle, either end may be made a
north pole at will; in fact, the poles of a weak magnet
can easily be reversed by properly rubbing it upon a
stronger magnet.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_33"></a>33. Theory of Magnetism.</b> Each little particle of a
piece of steel or iron is supposed to be a magnet, even
before it touches a magnet. When these little magnets
are thoroughly mixed up in the steel, they pull in all
sorts of directions upon each other and tend to keep the
steel from attracting outside bodies. When a magnet is
properly rubbed upon a bar of steel, the north poles of the
little molecular magnets of the steel are all made to point
in the same direction. As the north poles help each
other, the whole bar can attract outside bodies.</p>

<p>By jarring a magnet its molecules are thoroughly
shaken up; in fact, most of the magnetism can be
knocked out of a weak magnet by hammering it.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_34"></a>34. Retentivity.</b> The power that a piece of steel has
to hold magnetism is called <i>retentivity</i>. Different kinds
of steel have different retentivities. A sewing-needle of
good steel will retain magnetism for years, and it is
almost impossible to knock the magnetism out by
hammering it. Soft steel has very little retentivity,
because it does not contain much carbon. Soft iron,
which contains less carbon than steel, holds magnetism
very poorly; so it is not used for permanent magnets.
A little magnetism, however, will remain in the soft iron
after it is removed from a magnet. This is called <i>residual
magnetism</i>.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 313px;">
<img src="images/i_026a.png" width="313" height="412" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 27.</div>
</div>
<p><b><a id="par_35"></a>35. Heat and Magnetism.</b> Steel will completely
lose its magnetism when heated to redness, and a magnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
will not attract red-hot iron. The molecules of a piece
of red-hot iron are in such a state of rapid vibration that
they refuse to be brought into line by the magnet.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_36"></a>36. Induced Magnetism.</b>
A piece of soft iron
may be induced to become
a magnet by holding it
near a magnet, absolute
contact not being necessary.
When the soft iron is removed,
again, from the influence
of the magnet, its
magnetism nearly all disappears.
It is said to have
<i>temporary</i> magnetism; it
had <i>induced</i> magnetism. If
a piece of soft iron be held
near the north pole of a
magnet, as in Fig. 27,
poles will be produced in the soft iron, the one nearest
the magnet being the south pole, and the other the north
pole.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 28.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_37"></a>37. Magnetic Field.</b> If a bar magnet be laid upon
the table, and a compass be moved about it, the compass-needle
will be attracted by
the magnet, and it will point
in a different direction for
every position given to the
compass. This strange
power, called magnetism, reaches out on all sides of a
magnet. The magnet may be said to act by induction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
upon the compass-needle. The space around the magnet,
in which this inductive action takes place, is called the
<i>magnetic field</i>. Fig. 28 shows some of the positions
taken by a compass-needle when moved about on one side
of a bar magnet.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_38"></a>38. Magnetic Figures</b> can be made by sprinkling iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
filings upon a sheet of paper under which is placed a
magnet. Fig. 29 shows a magnetic figure made with an
ordinary bar magnet. The magnet was placed upon the
table and over this was laid
a piece of smooth paper.
Fine iron filings were sifted
upon the paper, which was
gently tapped so that the
filings could arrange themselves.
As each particle of
iron became a little magnet,
by induction, its poles were
attracted and repelled by
the magnet; and when the
paper was tapped they
swung around to their final
positions. Notice that the
filings have arranged themselves
in lines. These lines
show the positions of some
of the <i>lines of magnetic force</i>
which surrounded the
magnet.</p>

<p>These lines of force pass
from the north pole of a
magnet through the air on
all sides to its south pole.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 253px;">
<img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="253" height="600" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 31.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 30 shows a magnetic
figure made from two bar
magnets placed side by side, their unlike poles being
next to each other. Fig. 31 shows the magnetic figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of a horseshoe magnet with round poles, the poles being
uppermost.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_39"></a>39. The Use of Armatures.</b> A magnet attracts
iron most strongly at its poles, because it is at the poles
that the greatest number of lines of force pass into the
air. Lines of force pass easily through soft iron, which
is said to be a good conductor of them. Air is not a
good conductor of the lines of force; in order, then, for
the lines of force to pass from the north pole of a magnet
to its south pole, they must overcome this resistance of
the air, unless the armature is in place. A magnet will
gradually grow weaker when its armature is left off.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_40"></a>40. Terrestrial Magnetism.</b> As the compass-needle
points to the north and south, the earth must act like a
magnet. There is a place very far north, about a thousand
miles from the north pole of the earth, which is
called the earth's north magnetic pole. Compass-needles
point to this place, and not to the earth's real north pole.
You can see, then, that if a compass be taken north of
this magnetic pole, its north pole will point south. Lines
of force pass from the earth's north magnetic pole
through the air on all sides of the earth and enter the
earth's south magnetic pole. The compass-needle, in
pointing toward the north magnetic pole, merely takes
the direction of the earth's lines of force, just as the particles
of iron filings arrange themselves in the magnetic
figures.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_41"></a>41. Declination.</b> As the magnetic needle does not
point exactly to the north, an angle is formed between
the true north and south line and the line of the needle.
In Fig. 32 the line marked N S is the true north and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
south line. The <i>angle of variation</i>, or the declination, is
the angle A between the line N S and the compass-needle.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_42"></a>42. Dip or Inclination.</b> If a piece of steel be carefully
balanced upon a support, and then magnetized, it
will be found that it will no longer balance. The north
pole will <i>dip</i> or point downward. Fig. 33 shows what
happens to a needle when it is held in different positions
over a bar magnet. It
simply takes the directions
of the lines of force as
they pass from the north
to the south pole of the
magnet. As the earth's
lines of force pass in curves
from the north to the south
magnetic pole, you can
see why the magnetic
needle dips, unless its
south pole is made heavier
than its north. Magnetic
needles are balanced after they are magnetized.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 306px;">
<img src="images/i_030c.png" width="306" height="347" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 34.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 34 shows a simple form of dipping needle. These
are often used by geologists and miners. In the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of the prospector, the miner's compass, or dipping
needle, proves a serviceable guide to the discovery and
location of magnetic iron ore. In this instrument the
magnetic needle is carefully balanced upon a horizontal
axis within a graduated circle, and in which the needle
will be found to assume a position inclined to the horizon.
This angle of deviation is called the <i>inclination</i> or <i>dip</i>,
and varies in different latitudes, and even at different
times in the same place.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_43"></a>43. The Earth's Inductive Influence.</b> The earth's
magnetism acts inductively upon pieces of steel or iron
upon its surface. If a piece of steel or iron, like a stove
poker, for example, be held in a north and south line
with its north end dipping considerably, it will be in the
best position for the magnetism of the earth to act upon
it; that is, it will lie in the direction taken by the earth's
lines of force. If the poker be struck two or three times
with a hammer to shake up its molecules, we shall find,
upon testing it, that it has become magnetized. By this
method we can pound magnetism right out of the air with
a hammer. If the magnetized poker be held level, in an
east and west direction, it will no longer be acted upon to
advantage by the inductive influence of the earth, and
we can easily hammer the magnetism out of it again.

<small>HOW ELECTRICITY IS GENERATED BY THE VOLTAIC

<p><b><a id="par_44"></a>44. Early Experiments.</b> In 1786 Galvani, an
Italian physician, made experiments to study the effect of
static electricity upon the nervous excitability of animals,
and especially upon the frog. He found that electric
machines were not
necessary to produce
muscular contractions
or kicks of the
frog's legs, and that
they could be produced
when two different
metals, Fig.
35, like iron and
copper, for example,
were placed in proper
contact with a nerve
and a muscle and
then made to touch
each other. Galvani
first thought that the
frog generated the electricity instead of the metals.</p>

<p>Volta proved that the electricity was caused by the
contact of the metals. He used the condensing electroscope
as one means of proving that two dissimilar metals
become charged differently when in contact. Volta also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
carried out his belief by constructing
what is called a <i>Voltaic Pile</i>. He
thought that by making several pairs
of metals so arranged that all the
little currents would help each other,
a strong current could be generated.
Fig. 36 shows a <i>pile</i>, it being made by
placing a pair of zinc and copper discs
in contact with one another, then laying
on the copper disc a piece of
flannel soaked in brine, then on top of
this another pair, etc., etc. By connecting
the first zinc and the last
copper, quite a little current was produced.
This was a start from which
has been built our present knowledge
of electricity. Strictly speaking,
electricity is not generated by combinations
of metals or by cells; they
really keep up a difference of potential,
as will be seen.</p>

different kinds of electrifications may be produced by
friction; one positive, the other negative. Either can be
produced, at will, by using proper materials.
Fig. 37 shows a
section of a <i>simple cell</i>;
Fig. 38 shows another view.
Cu is a piece of copper,
and Zn a piece of zinc.
When they are placed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
dilute sulphuric acid, it can be shown by delicate apparatus
that they become charged differently, because the
acid acts differently upon the plates. They become
charged by chemical action, and not by friction. The
zinc is gradually dissolved, and it is this chemical burning
of the zinc that furnishes energy for the electric current
in the simple cell. The electrification, or charge, on
the plates tends to flow from the place of higher to the
place of lower potential, just as water tends to flow down
hill. If a wire be joined to the two metals, a constant
current of electricity will flow through it, because the
acid continues to act upon the plates. The simple cell
is a <i>single-fluid</i> cell, as but one liquid is used in its construction.</p>

<p><b>45a. Plates and Poles.</b> The metal strips used in
voltaic cells are called <i>plates</i> or <i>elements</i>. The one most
acted upon by the acid is called the positive (+) plate.
In the simple cell the zinc is the + plate, and the copper
the negative (-) plate. The end of a wire attached to
the - plate is called the + pole, or electrode. Fig. 37
shows the negative (-) electrode as the end of the wire
attached to the + plate.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_46"></a>46. Direction of Current.</b> In the cell the current
passes from the zinc to the copper; that is, from the positive
to the negative plate, where bubbles of hydrogen
gas are deposited. In the wire connecting the plates,
the current passes from the copper to the zinc plate. In
most cells, carbon takes the place of copper. (See
"Study," § 268.)</p>

<p><b><a id="par_47"></a>47. Local Currents; Amalgamation.</b> Ordinary
zinc contains impurities such as carbon, iron, etc., and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
when the acid comes in contact with these, they form
with the zinc a small cell. This tends to eat away the
zinc without producing useful currents. The little currents
in the cell from this cause are called <i>local currents</i>.
(See "Study," Exp. 111, § 273.) This is largely overcome
by coating the zinc with mercury. This process is
called <i>amalgamation</i>. It makes the zinc act like pure
zinc, which is not acted upon by dilute sulphuric acid
when the current does not pass. (See "Study," § 257,
274.)</p>

<p><b><a id="par_48"></a>48. Polarization of Cells.</b> Bubbles of hydrogen gas
are formed when zinc is dissolved by an acid. In the
ordinary simple cell these bubbles collect on the copper
plate, and not on the zinc plate, as might be expected.
The hydrogen is not a conductor of electricity, so this
film of gas holds the current back. The hydrogen acts
like a metal and sets up a current that opposes the zinc
to the copper current. Several methods are employed to
get rid of the hydrogen. (See "Study," § 278, 279,
280.)</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>VARIOUS VOLTAIC CELLS.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_49"></a>49. Single-Fluid and Two-Fluid Cells.</b> The simple
cell (§ 45) is a single-fluid cell. The liquid is called
the <i>electrolyte</i>, and this must act upon one of the plates;
that is, chemical action must take place in order to produce
a current. The simple cell polarizes rapidly, so
something must be used with the dilute sulphuric acid to
destroy the hydrogen bubbles. This is done in the
<i>bichromate of potash cell</i>.</p>

<p>In order to get complete depolarization&mdash;that is, to
keep the carbon plate almost perfectly free from hydrogen,
it is necessary to use <i>two-fluid cells</i>, or those to
which some solid depolarizer is added to the one fluid.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_50"></a>50. Open and Closed Circuit Cells.</b> If we consider
a voltaic cell, the wires attached to it, and perhaps some
instrument through which the current passes, we have an
<i>electric circuit</i>. When the current passes, the circuit is
<i>closed</i>, but when the wire is cut, or in any way disconnected
so that the current can not pass, the circuit is
<i>open</i> or <i>broken</i>. (See "Study," § 266.)</p>

<p><i>Open Circuit Cells</i> are those which can give momentary
currents at intervals, such as are needed for bells, telephones,
etc. These must have plenty of time to rest, as
they polarize when the circuit is closed for a long time.
The <i>Leclanché</i> and <i>dry</i> cells are the most common open
circuit cells.</p>

<p><i>Closed Circuit Cells.</i> For telegraph lines, motors, etc.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
where a current is needed for some time, the cell must be
of such a nature that it will not polarize quickly; it must
give a strong and constant current. The <i>bichromate</i> and
<i>gravity cells</i> are examples of this variety. (See "Study,"
§ 286.)</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 215px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 39.</div>
</div>
<p><b><a id="par_51"></a>51. Bichromate of Potash Cells</b> are very useful for
general laboratory work. They are especially useful for
operating induction coils, small
motors, small incandescent lamps,
for heating platinum wires, etc.
These cells have an E.M.F. of
about 2 volts. Dilute sulphuric
acid is used as the exciting fluid,
and in this is dissolved the bichromate
of potash which keeps
the hydrogen bubbles from the
carbon plate. (See "Apparatus
Book," § 26.) Zinc and carbon
are used for the plates, the +
pole being the wire attached to
the carbon.</p>



<p>Fig. 39 shows one form of bichromate
cell. It furnishes a large quantity of current,
and as the zinc can be raised from the fluid, it may be
kept charged ready for use for many months, and can be
set in action any time when required by lowering the
zinc into the liquid. Two of these cells will burn a one
candle-power miniature incandescent lamp several hours.
The carbon is indestructible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Note.</b> For various forms of home-made cells, see "Apparatus
Book," Chapter I., and for battery fluids see Chapter II.</p></blockquote>

<p><b><a id="par_52"></a>52. The Grenet Cell.</b> Fig. 40 is another form of
bichromate cell. The carbon plates are left in the fluid
constantly. The zinc plate should be raised when the
cell is not in use, to keep it from being uselessly dissolved.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_53"></a>53. Plunge Batteries.</b> Two or more cells are often
arranged so that their elements can be quickly lowered
into the acid solution. Such a combination, Fig. 41, is
called a <i>plunge battery</i>. The binding-posts are so arranged
that currents of different strengths can be taken from the
combination. The two binding-posts on the right of the
battery will give the current of one cell; the two binding-posts
on the left of the battery will give the current of
two cells, and the two end binding-posts will give the
current of all three cells. When not in use the elements
must always be hung on the hooks and kept out of the
solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="par_54"></a>54. Large Plunge Batteries</b>. Fig. 42, are arranged
with a winch and a bar above the cells; these afford a
ready and convenient means of lifting or lowering the
elements and avoiding waste. In the battery shown,
Fig. 42, the zincs are 4×6 inches; the carbons have the
same dimensions, but there are two carbon plates to each
zinc, thus giving double the carbon surface.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_55"></a>55. The Fuller Cell</b>, Fig. 43, is another type of
bichromate cell, used largely for long-distance telephone
service, for telephone exchange
and switch service, for running
small motors, etc. It consists of a
glass jar, a carbon plate, with
proper connections, a clay porous
cup, containing the zinc, which is
made in the form of a cone. A
little mercury is placed in the
porous cup to keep the zinc well
amalgamated. Either bichromate
of potash or bichromate of soda can
be used as a depolarizer.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_56"></a>56. The Gravity Cell</b>, sometimes called the <i>bluestone</i>
or <i>crowfoot</i> cell, is used largely for telegraph, police, and
fire-alarm signal service, laboratory
and experimental work, or whenever
a closed circuit cell is required. The
E.M.F. is about one volt. This is a
modified form of the Daniell cell. Fig.
44 shows a home-made gravity cell.</p>

<p>A copper plate is placed at the
bottom of the glass jar, and upon this
rests a solution of copper sulphate
(bluestone). The zinc plate is supported
about four inches above the
copper, and is surrounded by a solution
of zinc sulphate which floats upon the top of the
blue solution. An insulated wire reaches from the copper
to the top of the cell and forms
the positive pole. (See "Apparatus
Book," § 11 to 15, for home-made
gravity cell, its regulation,
etc. For experiments with two-fluid
Daniell cell, see "Study,"
Exp. 113, § 281 to 286.)</p>

zinc that stands in dilute sulphuric
acid, the carbon being in
nitric acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="par_57"></a>57. The Leclanché Cell</b> is an open circuit cell. Sal
ammoniac is used as the exciting fluid, carbon and zinc
being used for plates. Manganese dioxide is used as the
depolarizer; this surrounds the
carbon plate, the two being
either packed together in a
porous cup or held together in the form of cakes. The
porous cup, or pressed cake, stands in the exciting fluid.
The E. M. F. is about 1.5 volts.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_60"></a>60. Electrical Connections.</b> In experimental work,
as well as in the everyday work of the electrician, electrical
connections must constantly be made. One wire
must be joined to another, just for a moment, perhaps,
or one piece of apparatus must be put in an electric circuit
with other apparatus, or the current must be turned
on or off from motors, lamps, etc. In order to conveniently
and quickly make such connections, apparatus
called push-buttons, switches and binding-posts are used.</p>

finger upon a movable button, or knob, may ring a bell
a mile away, or do some other equally wonderful thing.
Fig. 51 shows a simple push-button, somewhat like a
simple key in construction. If we cut a wire, through
which a current is passing, then join one of the free ends
to the screw A and the other end to screw C, we shall be
able to let the current pass at any instant by pressing the
spring B firmly upon A.</p>

<p>Push-buttons are made in all sorts of shapes and sizes.
Fig. 52 gives an idea of the general internal construction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
The current enters A by one wire, and leaves by another
wire as soon as the button is pushed and B is forced
down to A. The bottom of the little button rests upon
the top of B.</p>

A, B, C, D, with the
contact-points 1, 2, 3,

in by simply swinging
the lever E around to

obliged to pass
through all the

out at Y. If E
be moved to 3,

regulators are made
upon this principle. (See

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>UNITS AND APPARATUS FOR ELECTRICAL MEASUREMENTS.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_64"></a>64. Electrical Units.</b> In order to measure electricity
for experimental or commercial purposes, standards or
units are just as necessary as the inch or foot for measuring
distances.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_65"></a>65. Potential; Electromotive Force.</b> If water in
a tall tank be allowed to squirt from two holes, one near
the bottom, the other near the top, it is evident that the
force of the water that comes from the hole at the bottom
will be the greater. The pressure at the bottom is greater
than that near the top, because the "head" is greater.</p>

<p>When a spark of static electricity jumps a long distance,
we say that the charge has a high <i>potential</i>; that is, it
has a high electrical pressure. Potential, for electricity,
means the same as pressure, for water. The greater the
potential, or <i>electromotive force</i> (E.M.F.) of a cell, the
greater its power to push a current through wires. (See
"Study," § 296 to 305, with experiments.)</p>

<p><b><a id="par_66"></a>66. Unit of E.M.F.; the Volt.</b>&mdash;In speaking of
water, we say that its pressure is so many pounds to the
square inch, or that it has a fall, or head, of so many
feet. We speak of a current as having so many volts;
for example, we say that a wire is carrying a 110-volt
current. The volt is the unit of E.M.F. An ordinary
gravity cell has an E.M.F. of about one volt. This
name was given in honor of Volta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="par_67"></a>67. Measurement of Electromotive Force.</b> There
are several ways by which the E.M.F. of a cell, for
example, can be
measured. It is
usually measured
<i>relatively</i>, by comparison
with the
E. M. F. of some
standard cell. (See
"Study," Exp.
140, for measuring
the E. M. F. of a
cell by comparison
with the two-fluid cell.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">
<img src="images/i_049a.jpg" width="386" height="292" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 62.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Voltmeters</i> are instruments by means of which E. M. F.
can be read on a printed scale. They are a variety of
galvanometer, and are made with coils of such high
resistance, compared with the resistance of a cell or
dynamo, that the E. M. F.
can be read direct. The
reason for this will be seen
by referring to Ohm's law
("Study," § 356); the
resistance is so great that
the strength of the current
depends entirely upon
the E. M. F.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/i_049b.jpg" width="312" height="297" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 63.</div>
</div>

<p>Voltmeters measure
electrical pressure just as
steam gauges measure the pressure of steam. Fig. 62
shows one form of voltmeter. Fig. 63 shows a voltmeter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
with illuminated dial. An electrical bulb behind the
instrument furnishes light so that the readings can be
easily taken.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_68"></a>68. Electrical Resistance.</b> Did you ever ride down
hill on a hand-sled? How easily the sled glides over the
snow! What happens, though, when you strike a bare
place, or a place where some evil-minded person has
sprinkled ashes? Does the sled pass easily over bare
ground or ashes? Snow offers
very little <i>resistance</i> to the sled,
while ashes offer a great resistance.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 243px;">
<img src="images/i_050.png" width="243" height="303" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 64.</div>
</div>

<p>All substances do not allow the
electric current to pass through
them with the same ease. Even
the liquid in a cell tends to hold
the current back and offers <i>internal
resistance</i>. The various
wires and instruments connected
to a cell offer <i>external resistance</i>.
(See "Study," Chapter XVIII., for experiments,
etc.)</p>

<p><b><a id="par_69"></a>69. Unit of Resistance.</b> <b>The Ohm</b> is the name given
to the unit of resistance. About 9 ft. 9 in. of No. 30
copper wire, or 39 feet 1 in. of No. 24 copper wire, will

Strength.</b> The
strength of a current
at the end of
a circuit depends
not only upon the
<i>electrical pressure</i>, or E. M. F., which drives the current,
but also upon the <i>resistance</i> which has to be overcome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
The greater the resistance the weaker the current at the

<p><b><a id="par_72"></a>72. Unit of Current Strength; The Ampere.</b> A
current having an E. M. F. of <i>one volt</i>, pushing its way
through a resistance of <i>one ohm</i>, would have a unit of
strength, called <i>one ampere</i>. This current, one ampere
strong, would deposit, under proper conditions, .0003277
gramme of copper in
<i>one second</i> from a solution
of copper sulphate.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_73"></a>73. Measurement
of Current Strength.</b>
A magnetic needle is
deflected when a current
passes around it,
as in instruments like
the galvanometer. The
<i>galvanoscope</i> merely indicates
the presence of
a current. <i>Galvanometers</i>
measure the
strength of a current,
and they are made in many forms, depending upon the
nature and strength of the currents to be measured.
Galvanometers are standardized, or calibrated, by special
measurements, or by comparison with some standard instrument,
so that when the deflection is a certain number
of degrees, the current passing through it is known to
be of a certain strength.</p>

Fig. 69 shows a <i>D'Arsonval galvanometer</i>, in which
a coil of wire is suspended between the

the solution to that which can pass through the meter by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<small>CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF THE ELECTRIC CURRENT.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_79"></a>79. Electrolysis.</b> It has been seen that in the voltaic
cell electricity is generated by chemical action. Sulphuric
acid acts upon zinc and dissolves it in the cell,
hydrogen is produced, etc. When this process is reversed,
that is, when the electric current is passed
through some solutions, they are decomposed, or broken
up into their constituents. This process is called <i>electrolysis</i>,
and the compound decomposed is the <i>electrolyte</i>.
(See "Study," § 369, etc., with experiments.)</p>

<p>Fig. 77 shows how water can be decomposed into its
two constituents, hydrogen and oxygen, there being
twice as much hydrogen formed as oxygen.</p>

<p>Fig. 78 shows a glass jar in which are placed two metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
strips, A and C, these being connected with two cells.
In this jar may be placed various conducting solutions to
be tested. If, for example, we use a solution of copper
sulphate, its chemical formula being CuSO<sub>4</sub>, the current
will break it up into Cu (copper) and SO<sub>4</sub>. The Cu will
be deposited upon C as the current passes from A to C
through the solution. A is called the <i>anode</i>, and C the
<i>cathode</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>HOW ELECTROPLATING AND ELECTROTYPING ARE DONE.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_81"></a>81. Electricity and Chemical Action.</b> We have
just seen, Chapter VII., that the electric current has the
power to decompose certain compounds when they are in
solution. By choosing the right solutions, then, we shall
be able to get copper, silver, and other metals set free by
electrolysis.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_82"></a>82. Electroplating</b> consists in coating substances
with metal with the aid of the electric current. If we
wish to electroplate a piece of metal with copper, for
example, we can use the arrangement shown in Fig. 78,
in which C is the cathode plate to be covered, and A is a
copper plate. The two are in a solution of copper sulphate,
and, as explained in § 79, the solution will be
decomposed. Copper will be deposited upon C, and the
SO<sub>4</sub> part of the solution will go to the anode A, which it
will attack and gradually dissolve. The SO<sub>4</sub>, acting upon
the copper anode, makes CuSO<sub>4</sub> again, and this keeps the
solution at a uniform strength. The amount of copper
dissolved from the copper anode equals, nearly, the
amount deposited upon the cathode. The metal is carried
in the direction of the current.</p>

<p>If we wish to plate something with silver or gold, it
will be necessary to use a solution of silver or gold for
the electrolyte, a plate of metallic silver or gold being
used for the anode, as the case may be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Great care is used in cleaning substances to be plated,
all dirt and grease being carefully removed.</p>

<p>Fig. 80 shows a plating bath in which several articles
can be plated at the same time by hanging them upon a
metal bar which really forms a part of the cathode. If,
for example, we wish to plate knives, spoons, etc., with
silver, they would be hung from the bar shown, each
being a part of the cathode. The vat would contain a
solution of silver, and from the other bar would be hung
a silver plate having a surface about equal to that of the
combined knives, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 486px;">
<img src="images/i_061.jpg" width="486" height="265" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 80.</div>
</div>

<p>Most metals are coated with copper before they are
plated with silver or gold. When plating is done on a
large scale, a current from a dynamo is used. For
experimental purposes a Gravity cell will do very well.
(See "Study," § 374 to 380 with experiments.)</p>

<p><b><a id="par_83"></a>83. Electrotyping.</b> It was observed by De La Rue
in 1836 that in the Daniell cell an even coating of copper
was deposited upon the copper plate. From this was
developed the process of electrotyping, which consists in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
making a copy in metal of a wood-cut, page of type, etc.
A mould or impression of the type or coin is first
made in wax, or other suitable material. These moulds
are, of course, the reverse of the original, and as they do
not conduct electricity, have to be coated with graphite.
This thin coating lines the mould with conducting
material so that the current can get to every part of the
mould. These are then hung upon the cathode in a bath
of copper sulphate as described in § 82. The electric
current which passes through the vat deposits a thin
layer of metallic copper next to the graphite. When this
copper gets thick enough, the wax is melted away from
it, leaving a thin shell of copper, the side next to the
graphite being exactly alike in shape to the type, but
made of copper. These thin copper sheets are too thin
to stand the pressure necessary on printing presses, so
they are strengthened by backing them with soft metal
which fills every crevice, making solid plates about ¼ in.
thick. These plates or <i>electrotypes</i> are used to print
from, the original type being used to set up another page.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>THE STORAGE BATTERY, AND HOW IT WORKS.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_84"></a>84. Polarization.</b> It has been stated that a simple
cell polarizes rapidly on account of hydrogen bubbles that
form upon the copper plate. They tend to send a current
in the opposite direction to that of the main current,
which is thereby weakened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/i_063.jpg" width="356" height="243" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 81.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_85"></a>85. Electromotive Force of Polarization.</b> It has
been shown, Fig. 71, that water can be decomposed by
the electric current.
Hydrogen and
oxygen have a
strong attraction or
chemical affinity for
each other, or they
would not unite to
form water. This
attraction has to be
overcome before the
water can be decomposed. As soon as the decomposing
current ceases to flow, the gases formed try to rush together
again; in fact, if the water voltameter be disconnected
from the cells and connected with a galvanoscope,
the presence of a current will be shown. This voltameter
will give a current with an E. M. F. of nearly 1.5
volts; so it is evident that we must have a current with a
higher voltage than this to decompose water. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
E. M. F., due to polarization, is called the E. M. F. of
polarization.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_86"></a>86. Secondary or Storage Batteries</b>, also called
<i>accumulators</i>, do not really store electricity. They must
be charged by a current before they can give out any
electricity. Chemical changes are produced in the storage
cells by the charging current just as they are in voltameters,
electroplating solutions, etc.; so it is potential
chemical energy that is really
stored. When the new products
are allowed to go back
to their original state, by
joining the electrodes of the
charged cell, a current is produced.</p>

<p>Fig. 81 shows two lead
plates, A and B, immersed in
dilute sulphuric acid, and
connected with two ordinary
cells. A strong current will
pass through the liquid between
A and B at first, but it
will quickly become weaker, as chemical changes take
place in the liquid. This may be shown by a galvanometer
put in the circuit before beginning the experiment.
By disconnecting the wires from the cells and
joining them to the galvanometer, it will be shown that
a current comes from the lead plates. This arrangement
may be called a simple storage cell. Regular storage cells
are charged with the current from a dynamo. (See
"Study," Exp. 151.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 272px;">
<img src="images/i_064.jpg" width="272" height="349" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 82.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>The first storage cells were made of plain lead plates,
rolled up in such a way that they were close to each
other, but did not touch. These were placed in dilute
sulphuric acid. They were charged in alternate directions
several times, until the lead became properly acted
upon, at which time the cell would furnish a current.</p>

<p>A great improvement was made in 1881, by Faure, who
coated the plates with red lead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 507px;">
<img src="images/i_065.jpg" width="507" height="346" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 83.</div>
</div>

<p>The method now generally practiced is to cast a frame
of lead, with raised right-angled ribs on each side, thus
forming little depressed squares, or to punch a lead plate
full of holes, which squares or holes are then filled with
a pasty mixture of red oxide of lead in positive plates,
and with litharge in negatives. In a form called the
chloride battery, instead of cementing lead oxide paste
into or against a lead framing in order to obtain the
necessary active material, the latter is obtained by a
strictly chemical process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 82 shows a storage cell with plates, etc., contained
in a glass jar. Fig. 83 shows a cell of 41 plates, set up in
a lead-lined wood tank. Fig. 84 shows three cells joined
in series. Many storage cells are used in central electric
light stations to help the dynamos during the "rush"
hours at night. They are charged during the day when
the load on the dynamos is not heavy.</p>

<p>Fig. 85 shows another form of storage cell containing
a number of plates.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 466px;">
<img src="images/i_066.jpg" width="466" height="321" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 84.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_87"></a>87. The Uses of Storage Batteries</b> are almost
numberless. The current can be used for nearly everything
for which a constant current is adapted, the following
being some of its applications: Carriage propulsion;
electric launch propulsion; train lighting; yacht lighting;
carriage lighting; bicycle lighting; miners' lamps; dental,
medical, surgical, and laboratory work; phonographs;
kinetoscopes; automaton pianos; sewing-machine motors;
fan motors; telegraph; telephone; electric bell; electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
fire-alarm; heat regulating; railroad switch and signal
apparatus.</p>

<p>By the installing of a storage plant many natural but
small sources of power may be utilized in furnishing light
and power; sources which otherwise are not available,
because not large enough to supply maximum demands.
The force of the tides, of small water powers from irrigating
ditches, and even of the wind, come under this
heading.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 306px;">
<img src="images/i_067.jpg" width="306" height="364" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 85.</div>
</div>

<p>As a regulator of pressure, in case of fluctuations in
the load, the value of a storage plant is inestimable.
These fluctuations of load are particularly noticeable in
electric railway plants, where the demand is constantly
rising and falling, sometimes jumping from almost nothing
to the maximum, and <i>vice versa</i>, in a few seconds.
If for no other reason than the prevention of severe
strain on the engines and generators, caused by these
fluctuations of demand, a storage plant will be valuable.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />
<small>HOW ELECTRICITY IS GENERATED BY HEAT.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_88"></a>88. Thermoelectricity</b> is the name given to electricity
that is generated by heat. If a strip of iron, I, be connected
between two strips of copper, C C, these being
joined by a copper wire, C W, we shall have an arrangement
that will generate a current when heated at either
of the junctions between C and I. When it is heated
at A the current will
flow as shown by
arrows, from C to I.
If we heat at B, the
current will flow in
the opposite direction
through the metals,
although it will still
go from C to I as before. Such currents are called
<i>thermoelectric currents</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="345" height="196" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 86.</div>
</div>

<p>Different pairs of metals produce different results.
Antimony and bismuth are generally used, because the
greatest effect is produced by them. If the end of a strip
of bismuth be soldered to the end of a similar strip of
antimony, and the free ends be connected to a galvanometer
of low resistance, the presence of a current will be
shown when the point of contact becomes hotter than the
rest of the circuit. The current will flow from bismuth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to antimony across the joint. By cooling the juncture
below the temperature of the rest of the circuit, a current
will be produced in the opposite direction to the above.
The energy of the current is kept up by the heat absorbed,
just as it is kept up by chemical action in the voltaic
cell.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_89"></a>89. Peltier Effect.</b> If an electric current be passed
through pairs of metals, the parts at the junction become
slightly warmer or cooler than before, depending upon
the direction of the current. This action is really the
reverse of that in which currents are produced by heat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/i_069.jpg" width="309" height="201" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 87.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_90"></a>90. Thermopiles.</b> As the E.M.F. of the current
produced by a single pair of metals is very small, several
pairs are usually joined in series, so that the different
currents will help each other by flowing in the same direction.
Such combinations are called thermoelectric piles,
or simply <i>thermopiles</i>.</p>

<p>Fig. 87 shows such an arrangement, in which a large
number of elements are placed in a small space. The
junctures are so arranged that the alternate ones come
together at one side.</p>

<p>Fig. 88 shows a thermopile connected with a galvanometer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
The heat of a match, or the cold of a piece of ice,
will produce a current, even if held at some distance from
the thermopile. The galvanometer should be a short-coil
astatic one. (See "Study," Chapter XXIV., for
experiments and home-made thermopile.)</p>

that is developed by electricity. We have seen that
if a magnetic needle be placed in the field of a magnet, its
N pole will point in the direction taken by the lines of
force as they pass from the N to the S pole of the magnet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 89.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_92"></a>92. Lines of Force about a Wire.</b> When a current
passes through a wire, the magnetic needle placed over or
under it tends to take a position at right angles to the
wire. Fig. 89 shows such a wire and needle, and how
the needle is deflected; it twists right around from its N
and S position as soon as the current begins to flow.
This shows that the lines of force pass <i>around</i> the wire
and not in the direction of its length. The needle does
not swing entirely perpendicular to the wire, that is, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the E and W line, because the earth is at the same time
pulling its N pole toward the N.</p>

<p>Fig. 90 shows a bent wire through which a current
passes from C to Z. If you look along the wire from C
toward the points A and B, you will see that <i>under</i> the
wire the lines of force pass to the left. Looking along
the wire from Z toward D you will see that the lines of
force pass opposite to the above, as the current comes
<i>toward</i> you. This is learned by experiment. (See
"Study," Exp. 152, § 385, etc.)</p>

<img src="images/i_072b.png" width="185" height="94" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 91.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Rule.</i> Hold the right hand with the thumb extended
(Fig. 89) and with the fingers pointing in the direction of
the current, the palm being toward the needle and on
the opposite side of the wire from the needle. The north-seeking
pole will then be deflected in the direction in
which the thumb points.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_93"></a>93. Current Detectors.</b> As there is a magnetic field
about a wire when a current passes through it, and as the
magnetic needle is affected, we have a means of detecting
the presence of a current. When the current is strong it
is simply necessary to let it pass once over or under a
needle; when it is weak, the wire must pass several
times above and below the needle, Fig. 91, to give the
needle motion. (See "Apparatus Book," Chapter XIII.,
for home-made detectors.)</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 92.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_94"></a>94. Astatic Needles and Detectors.</b> By arranging
two magnetized needles with their poles opposite each
other, Fig. 92, an <i>astatic needle</i> is formed. The pointing-power
is almost nothing, although their magnetic
fields are retained. This combination
is used to detect feeble
currents. In the ordinary detector,
the tendency of the needle
to point to the N and S has to be
overcome by the magnetic field
about the coil before the needle
can be moved; but in the <i>astatic detector</i> and <i>galvanoscope</i>
this pointing-power is done away with. Fig. 93
shows a simple <i>astatic galvanoscope</i>. Fig. 67 shows an
astatic galvanometer for measuring weak currents.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 352px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 93.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_95"></a>95. Polarity of Coils.</b> When a current of electricity
passes through a coil of wire, the
coil acts very much like a magnet,
although no iron enters into its
construction. The coil becomes
magnetized by the electric current,
lines of force pass from it
into the air, etc. Fig. 94 shows a
coil connected to copper and zinc
plates, so arranged with cork that
the whole can float in a dish of
dilute sulphuric acid. The current
passes as shown by the
arrows, and when the N pole of a magnet is brought
near the right-hand end, there is a repulsion, showing
that that end of the coil has a N pole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rule.</i> When you face the right-hand end of the coil,
the current is seen to pass around it in an anti-clockwise
direction; this produces a N pole. When the current
passes in a clockwise direction a S pole is produced.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 228px;">
<img src="images/i_074.png" width="228" height="333" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 94.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_96"></a>96. Electromagnets.</b>
A coil of wire has a stronger
field than a straight wire
carrying the same current,
because each turn adds its
field to the fields of the
other turns. By having the
central part of the coil
made of iron, or by having
the coil of insulated wire
wound upon an iron <i>core</i>,
the strength of the magnetic
field of the coil is
greatly increased.</p>

<p>Lines of force do not
pass as readily through air
as through iron; in fact,
lines of force will go out of their way to go through
iron. With a coil of wire the lines of force pass from its
N pole through the air on all sides of the coil to its S
pole; they then pass through the inside of the coil and
through the air back to the N pole. When the resistance
to their passage through the coil is decreased by the
core, the magnetic field is greatly strengthened, and we
have an <i>electromagnet</i>.</p>

<p>The coil of wire temporarily magnetizes the iron core;
it can permanently magnetize a piece of steel used as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a core. (See "Study," Chapter XXII., for experiments.)</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 520px;">
<img src="images/i_075.png" width="520" height="389" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 95.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_97"></a>97. Forms of Electromagnets.</b> Fig. 95 shows a
<i>straight, or bar electromagnet</i>. Fig. 96 shows a simple
form of <i>horseshoe electromagnet</i>. As this form is not easily
wound, the coils are generally wound on two separate
cores which are then joined by a <i>yoke</i>. The yoke
merely takes the place of the curved part shown in Fig.
96. In Fig. 97 is shown the ordinary form of horseshoe
electromagnet used for all sorts of electrical instruments.
(See "Apparatus Book," Chapter IX., for home-made
electromagnets.)</p>

<p><b><a id="par_98"></a>98. Yokes and Armatures.</b> In the horseshoe magnet
there are two poles to attract and two to induce. The
lines of force pass through the yoke on their way from
one core to the other, instead of going through the air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
This reduces the resistance to them. If we had no yoke
we should simply have two straight electromagnets, and
the resistance to the lines of force would be so great that
the total strength would be much reduced. Yokes are
made of soft iron, as well as the cores and armature. The
<i>armature</i>, as with permanent horseshoe magnets, is
strongly drawn toward the poles. As soon as the current
ceases to flow, the attraction also ceases.</p>

<p>Beautiful magnetic figures can be made with horseshoe
magnets. Fig. 98 shows that the coils must be joined so
that the current can pass around the cores in opposite
directions to make unlike poles. (See "Study," Exp.
164 to 173.)</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<small>HOW ELECTRICITY IS GENERATED BY INDUCTION.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_99"></a>99. Electromagnetic Induction.</b> We have seen that
a magnet has the power to act through space and induce
another piece of iron or steel to become a magnet. A
charge of static electricity can induce a charge upon
another conductor. We have now to see how a <i>current</i>
of electricity in one conductor can induce a current in
another conductor, not in any way connected with the
first, and how a magnet and a coil can generate a current.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_100"></a>100. Current from Magnet and Coil.</b> If a bar magnet,
Fig. 99, be suddenly thrust into a hollow coil of
wire, a momentary current of electricity will be generated
in the coil. No current passes when the magnet and coil
are still; at least one of them must be in motion. Such a
current is said to be <i>induced</i>, and is an <i>inverse</i> one when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the magnet is inserted, and a <i>direct</i> one when the magnet
is withdrawn from the coil.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_101"></a>101. Induced Currents and Lines of Force.</b> Permanent
magnets are constantly sending out thousands of
lines of force. Fig. 100 shows a bar magnet entering a
coil of wire; the number of lines of force is increasing,
and the induced current passes in an anti-clockwise direction
when looking down into the coil along the lines of
force. This produces an indirect current. If an iron
core be used in the coil, the induced current will be
greatly strengthened.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 538px;">
<img src="images/i_078.jpg" width="538" height="315" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 101.</div>
</div>

<p>It takes force to move a magnet through the center of
a coil, and it is this work that is the source of the induced
current. We have, in this simple experiment, the key to
the action of the dynamo and other electrical machines.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_102"></a>102. Current from two Coils.</b> Fig. 101 shows two
coils of wire, the smaller being connected to a cell, the
larger to a galvanometer. By moving the small coil up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and down inside of the large one, induced currents are
generated, first in one direction and then in the opposite.
We have here two entirely separate circuits, in no way
connected. The <i>primary</i> current comes from the cell,
while the <i>secondary</i> current is an induced one. By placing
a core in the small coil of Fig. 101, the induced current
will be greatly strengthened.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to have the two coils so that one or
both of them can move. They may be wound on the
same core, or otherwise arranged as in the induction coil.
(See "Study," Chapter XXV., for experiments on
induced currents.)</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<small>HOW THE INDUCTION COIL WORKS.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_103"></a>103. The Coils.</b> We saw, § 102, that an induced
current was generated when a current-carrying coil, Fig.
101, was thrust into another coil connected with a galvanometer.
The galvanometer was used merely to show the
presence of the current. The <i>primary coil</i> is the one
connected with the cell; the other one is called the <i>secondary
coil</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;">
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" width="459" height="289" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 102.</div>
</div>

<p>When a current suddenly begins to flow through a coil,
the effect upon a neighboring coil is the same as that produced
by suddenly bringing a magnet near it; and when
the current stops, the opposite effect is produced. It is
evident, then, that we can keep the small coil of Fig. 101
with its core inside of the large coil, and generate induced
currents by merely making and breaking the primary
circuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>We may consider that when the primary circuit is
closed, the lines of force shoot out through the turns of
the secondary coil just as they do when a magnet or a
current-carrying coil is thrust into it. Upon opening the
circuit, the lines of force cease to exist; that is, we may
imagine them drawn in again.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_104"></a>104. Construction.</b> Fig. 102 shows one form of
home-made induction coil, given here merely to explain
the action and connections. Nearly all induction coils
have some form of automatic current interrupter, placed
in the primary circuit, to rapidly turn the current off
and on.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 202px;">
<img src="images/i_081.png" width="202" height="153" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 103.</div>
</div>
<p><i>Details of Figs. 102 and 103.</i> Wires 5 and 6 are the
ends of the primary coil, while
wires 7 and 8 are the terminals of
the secondary coil. The primary
coil is wound on a bolt which
serves as the core, and on this
coil is wound the secondary which
consists of many turns of fine wire.
The wires from a battery should be joined to binding-posts
W and X, and the handles, from which the shock is
felt, to Y and Z. Fig. 103 shows the details of the interrupter.</p>



<p>If the current from a cell enters at W, it will pass
through the primary coil and out at X, after going
through 5, R, F, S I, B, E and C. The instant the
current passes, the bolt becomes magnetized; this attracts
A, which pulls B away from the end of S I, thus automatically
opening the circuit. B at once springs back to
its former position against SI, as A is no longer attracted;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the circuit being closed, the operation is rapidly
repeated.</p>

<p>A <i>condenser</i> is usually connected to commercial forms.
It is placed under the wood-work and decreases sparking
at the interrupter. (See "Apparatus Book," Chapter
XI., for home-made induction coils.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 384px;">
<img src="images/i_082.jpg" width="384" height="241" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 104.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 104 shows one form of coil. The battery wires
are joined to the binding-posts at the left. The secondary
coil ends in two rods, and the spark jumps from one to
the other. The interrupter and a switch are shown at
the left.</p>

<p>Fig. 105 shows a small coil for medical purposes. A
dry cell is placed under the coil and all is included in
a neat box. The handles form the terminals of the
secondary coil.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_105"></a>105. The Currents.</b> It should be noted that the
current from the cell does not get into the secondary coil.
The coils are thoroughly insulated from each other. The
secondary current is an induced one, its voltage depending
upon the relative number of turns of wire there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in the two coils. (See Transformers.) The secondary
current is an alternating one; that is, it flows in one
direction for an instant and then immediately reverses its
direction. The rapidity of the alternations depends upon
the speed of the interrupter. Coils are made that give a
secondary current with an enormous voltage; so high, in
fact, that the spark will pass many inches, and otherwise
act like those produced by static electric machines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 328px;">
<img src="images/i_083.jpg" width="328" height="267" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 105.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_106"></a>106. Uses of Induction Coils.</b> Gas-jets can be
lighted at a distance with the spark from a coil, by extending
wires from the secondary coil to the jet. Powder
can be fired at a distance, and other things performed,
when a high voltage current is needed. Its use in medicine
has been noted. It is largely used in telephone work.
Of late, great use has been made of the secondary current
in experiments with vacuum-tubes, X-ray work, etc.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<small>THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH, AND HOW IT SENDS
MESSAGES.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_107"></a>107. The Complete Telegraph Line</b> consists of
several instruments, switches, etc., etc., but its essential
parts are: The <i>Line</i>, or wire, which connects the different
stations; the <i>Transmitter</i> or <i>Key</i>; the <i>Receiver</i> or
<i>Sounder</i>, and the <i>Battery</i> or <i>Dynamo</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_108"></a>108. The Line</b> is made of strong copper, iron, or soft
steel wire. To keep the current in the line it is insulated,
generally upon poles, by glass insulators. For
very short lines two wires
can be used, the line wire
and the return; but for long
lines the earth is used as a
return, a wire from each
end being joined to large metal plates sunk in the earth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 269px;">
<img src="images/i_084.jpg" width="269" height="91" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 106.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_109"></a>109. Telegraph Keys</b> are merely instruments by
which the circuit can be conveniently and rapidly opened
or closed at the will of the operator. An ordinary push-button
may be used to turn the current off and on, but it
is not so convenient as a key.</p>

<p>Fig. 106 shows a side view of a simple key which can
be put anywhere in the circuit, one end of the cut wire
being attached to X and the other to Y. By moving the
lever C up and down according to a previously arranged
set of signals, a current will be allowed to pass to a distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
station. As X and Y are insulated from each other,
the current can pass only when C presses against Y.</p>

<p>Fig. 107 shows a regular key, with switch, which is
used to allow the current to pass through the instrument
when receiving a message.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">
<img src="images/i_085a.jpg" width="432" height="167" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 107.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_110"></a>110. Telegraph Sounders</b> receive the current from
some distant station, and with its electromagnet produce
sounds that can be translated into messages.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/i_085b.jpg" width="491" height="119" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 108.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 108 shows simply an electromagnet H, the coil
being connected in series with a key K and a cell D C.
The key and D C are shown by a top view. The lever
of K does not touch the other metal strap until it is
pressed down. A little above the core of H is held a
strip of iron, on armature I. As soon as the circuit is
closed at K, the current rushes through the circuit, and
the core attracts I making a distinct <i>click</i>. As soon as
K is raised, I springs away from the core, if it has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
properly held. In regular instruments a click is also
made when the armature springs back again.</p>

<p>The time between the two clicks can be short or long,
to represent <i>dots</i> or <i>dashes</i>,
which, together with <i>spaces</i>,
represent letters. (For
Telegraph Alphabet and
complete directions for
home-made keys, sounders,
etc., see "Apparatus

<p>Fig. 109 shows a form of
home-made sounder. Fig.
110 shows one form of telegraph sounder. Over the poles
of the horseshoe electromagnet is an armature fixed to a
metal bar that can rock up and down. The instant the
current passes through the coils the armature comes
down until a stop-screw strikes firmly upon the metal
frame, making the down click. As soon as the distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
key is raised, the armature is firmly pulled back and
another click is made. The two clicks differ in sound,
and can be readily recognized by the operator.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_111"></a>111. Connections for Simple Line.</b> Fig. 111 shows
complete connections for a home-made telegraph line.
The capital letters are used for the right side, R, and
small letters for the left side, L. Gravity cells, B and b,
are used. The <i>sounders</i>, S and s, and the <i>keys</i>, K and k,
are shown by a top view. The broad black lines of S and
s represent the armatures which are directly over the
electromagnets. The keys have switches, E and e.</p>

<p>The two stations, R and L, may be in the same room,
or in different houses.
The <i>return wire</i>, R W,
passes from the copper
of b to the zinc of B.
This is important, as the
cells must help each
other; that is, they are
in series. The <i>line wire</i>,
L W, passes from one
station to the other, and the return may be through the
wire, R W, or through the earth; but for short lines a
wire is best.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 323px;">

<div class="caption">Fig. 111.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_112"></a>112. Operation of Simple Line.</b> Suppose two boys,
R (right) and L (left) have a line. Fig. 111 shows that
R's switch, E, is open, while e is closed. The entire
circuit, then, is broken at but one point. As soon as R
presses his key, the circuit is closed, and the current from
both cells rushes around from B, through K, S, L W, s,
k, b, R W, and back to B. This makes the armatures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
S and s come down with a click at the same time. As
soon as the key is raised, the armatures lift and make
the up-click. As soon as R has finished, he closes his
switch E. As the armatures are then held down, L
knows that R has finished, so he opens his switch e, and
answers R. Both E and e are closed when the line is not
in use, so that either can open his switch at any time and
call up the other. Closed circuit cells must be used for
such lines. On very large lines dynamos are used to
furnish the current.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_113"></a>113. The Relay.</b> Owing to the large resistance of
long telegraph lines, the current is weak when it reaches
a distant station, and not strong enough to work an
ordinary sounder. To get around this, relays are used;
these are very delicate instruments that replace the
sounder in the line wire circuit. Their coils are usually
wound with many turns of fine wire, so that a feeble
current will move its nicely adjusted armature. The
relay armature merely acts as an automatic key to open
and close a local circuit which includes a battery and
sounder. The line current does not enter the sounder; it
passes back from the relay to the sending station through
the earth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 564px;">
<img src="images/i_088.jpg" width="564" height="95" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 112.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 112 gives an idea of simple relay connections.
The key K, and cell D C, represent a distant sending
station. E is the electromagnet of the relay, and R A is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
its armature. L W and R W represent the line and
return wires. R A will vibrate toward E every time K
is pressed, and close the local circuit, which includes a
local battery, L B, and a sounder. It is evident that as
soon as K is pressed the sounder will work with a good
strong click, as the local battery can be made as strong
as desired.</p>

<p>Fig. 113 shows a regular instrument which opens and
closes the local circuit at the top of the armature.</p>

instead of sounders. Fig. 114 shows a writing register
that starts itself promptly at the opening of the circuit,
and stops automatically as soon as the circuit returns to
its normal condition. A strip of narrow paper is slowly
pulled from the reel by the machine, a mark being made
upon it every time the armature of an inclosed electromagnet
is attracted. When the circuit is simply closed
for an instant, a short line, representing a <i>dot</i>, is made.</p>

<p>Registers are built both single pen and double pen.

always be identified. The record being blocked out upon
white tape in solid black color, in a series of clean-cut
dots and dashes, it can be read at a glance, and as it is
indelible, it may be read years afterward. Registers are
made for local circuits, for use in connection with relays,
or for direct use on main lines, as is usually desirable in
fire-alarm circuits.</p>

<small>THE ELECTRIC BELL AND SOME OF ITS USES.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_115"></a>115. Automatic Current Interrupters</b> are used on
most common bells, as well as on induction coils, etc.
(See § 104.) Fig. 115
shows a simple form
of interrupter. The
wire 1, from a cell D
C, is joined to an iron
strip I a short distance
from its end. The
other wire from D C passes to one end of the electromagnet
coil H. The remaining end of H is placed in
contact with I as shown, completing the circuit. As soon
as the current passes, I is pulled down and away from
the upper wire 2, breaking the circuit. I, being held by
its left-hand end firmly in the hand, immediately springs
back to its former position, closing the circuit again.
This action is repeated, the rapidity of the vibrations
depending somewhat upon the position of the wires on I.
In regular instruments a platinum point is used where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the circuit is broken; this stands
the sparking when the armature
vibrates.</p>

illustrated by referring to Fig.
116, which shows a circuit similar
to that described in § 115,
but which also contains a key
K, in the circuit. This allows
the circuit to be opened and
closed at a distance from the
vibrating armature. The circuit
must not be broken at two
places at the same time, so wires
should touch at the end of I before
pressing K. Upon pressing K the armature I will
vibrate rapidly. By placing a small bell near the end of
the vibrating armature, so
that it will be struck by I at
each vibration, we should
have a simple electric bell.
This form of electric bell is
called a <i>trembling</i> bell, on
account of its vibrating armature.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_119"></a>119. The Telephone</b> is an instrument for reproducing
sounds at a distance, and electricity is the agent by
which this is generally accomplished. The part spoken
to is called the <i>transmitter</i>, and the part which gives
sound out again is called the <i>receiver</i>. Sound itself does
not pass over the line. While the same apparatus can be
used for both transmitter and receiver, they are generally

<p><b><a id="par_120"></a>120. The Bell or Magneto-transmitter</b> generates
its own current, and is, strictly speaking, a dynamo that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
is run by the voice. It depends upon induction for its
action.</p>

</div>

<p>Fig. 125 shows a coil of wire, H, with soft iron core,
the ends of the wires being connected to a delicate galvanoscope.
If one pole of the magnet H M be suddenly
moved up and down near the core, an alternating current
will be generated in the coil, the circuit being completed
through the galvanoscope. As H M approaches the core
the current will flow in one direction, and as H M is
withdrawn it will pass in the opposite direction. The
combination makes a miniature alternating dynamo.</p>


<p>If we imagine the soft iron core of H, Fig. 125, taken
out, and one pole of H M, or preferably that of a bar
magnet stuck through the coil, a feeble current will also
be produced by moving the soft iron
back and forth near the magnet's pole.
This is really what is done in the
Bell transmitter, soft iron in the shape
of a thin disc (D, Fig. 126) being
made to vibrate by the voice immediately
in front of a coil having a permanent
magnet for a core. The disc,
or <i>diaphragm</i>, as it is called, is fixed
near, but it does not touch, the magnet. It is under a
constant strain, being attracted by the magnet, so its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
slightest movement changes the strength of the magnetic
field, causing more or less lines of force to shoot through
the turns of the coil and induce a current. The coil consists
of many turns of fine, insulated wire. The current
generated is an alternating one, and although exceedingly
small can force its way through a long length of wire.</p>

lines, may have
the same construction
as the
Bell transmitter.
Fig. 130 shows
a diagram of two
Bell receivers, either being used as the transmitter and
the other as the receiver. As the alternating current
goes to the distant receiver, it flies through the coil
first in one direction and then in the other. This alternately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
strengthens and weakens the magnetic field
near the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate back and forth
as the magnet pulls more or less. The receiver diaphragm
repeats the vibrations in the transmitter.
Nothing but the induced electric current passes over the
wires.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_122"></a>122. The Microphone.</b> If a current of electricity be
allowed to pass through a circuit like that shown in Fig.
131, which includes a battery, a Bell receiver, and a
microphone, any slight sound near the microphone will
be greatly magnified in the receiver. The microphone
consists of pieces of carbon so fixed that they form loose
contacts. Any slight movement of the carbon causes the
resistance to the current to be greatly changed. The
rapidly varying resistance allows more or less current to
pass, the result being that this pulsating current causes
the diaphragm to vibrate. The diaphragm has a constantly
varying pull upon it when the carbons are in any
way disturbed by the voice, or by the ticking of a watch,
etc. This principle has been made use of in carbon
transmitters, which are made in a large variety of forms.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_123"></a>123. The Carbon Transmitter</b> does not, in itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
generate a current like the magneto-transmitter; it merely
produces changes in the strength of a current that flows
through it and that comes from
some outside source. In Fig.
132, X and Y are two carbon
buttons, X being attached to
the diaphragm D. Button Y
presses gently against X, allowing
a little current to pass
through the circuit which includes
a battery, D C, and a receiver,
R. When D is caused to
vibrate by the voice, X is made
to press more or less against Y,
and this allows more or less
current to pass through the circuit.
This direct undulating
current changes the pull upon
the diaphragm of R, causing it to vibrate and reproduce
the original sounds spoken into the transmitter. In
regular lines, of course, a receiver and transmitter are
connected at each end, together with bells, etc., for
signaling.</p>

</div>

<p><b><a id="par_124"></a>124. Induction Coils in Telephone Work.</b> As the
resistance of long telephone lines is great, a high electrical
pressure, or E.M.F. is desired. While the current
from one or two cells is sufficient to work the transmitter
properly, and cause undulating currents in the short line,
it does not have power enough to force its way over a
long line.</p>

<p>To get around this difficulty, an induction coil, Fig. 133,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
is used to transform the battery
current, that flows through the
carbon transmitter and primary
coil, into a current with a high
E. M. F. The battery current
in the primary coil is undulating,
but always passes in the
same direction, making the
magnetic field around the core
weaker and stronger. This
causes an alternating current
in the secondary coil and main
line. In Fig. 133 P and S represent
the primary and secondary
coils. P is joined in series
with a cell and carbon transmitter;
S is joined to the distant
receiver. One end of S can be
grounded, the current completing
the circuit through the earth
and into the receiver through another
wire entering the earth.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<small>HOW ELECTRICITY IS GENERATED BY DYNAMOS.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_126"></a>126. The Dynamo</b>, <i>Dynamo-Electric Machine</i> or <i>Generator</i>,
is a machine for converting mechanical energy into
an electric current, through electromagnetic induction.
The dynamo is a machine that will convert steam power,
for example, into an electric current. Strictly speaking,
a dynamo creates electrical pressure, or electromotive
force, and not electricity, just as a force-pump creates
water-pressure, and not water. They are generally run
by steam or water power.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_127"></a>127. Induced Currents.</b> We have already spoken
about currents being induced by moving a coil of wire in
a magnetic field. We shall now see how this principle
is used in the dynamo which is a generator of induced
currents.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 102px;">

<p>Fig. 137 shows how a current can be generated by a

coil of wire having an iron core. The ends of the coil are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to be connected to an astatic galvanoscope; this forms a
closed circuit. The coil may be moved past the magnet,

<p>Fig. 139 shows how a current can be generated by two
coils, H being connected to an astatic galvanoscope and
E to a battery. By suddenly bringing E toward H or
the core of E past that of H, a current is produced. We
have in this arrangement the main features of a dynamo.
We can reverse the operation, holding E in one position
and moving H rapidly toward it. In this case H would
represent the armature and E the field-magnet. When
H is moved toward E, the induced current in H flows in
one direction, and when H is suddenly withdrawn from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
E the current is reversed in H. (See "Study," Chapter
XXV., for experiments.)</p>

<p><b><a id="par_128"></a>128. Induced Currents
by Rotary Motion.</b> The
motions of the coils in
straight lines are not suitable
for producing currents
strong enough for commercial
purposes. In order
to generate currents of
considerable strength and
pressure, the coils of wire
have to be pushed past
magnets, or electromagnets,
with great speed. In the
dynamo the coils are so wound that they can be given
a rapid rotary motion as they fly past strong electromagnets.
In this way the
coil can keep on passing
the same magnets, in the
same direction, as long as
force is applied to the shaft
that carries them.</p>

What we need then,
to produce an induced
current by a rotary motion,
is a strong magnetic field,
a rotating coil of wire
properly placed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
field, and some means of leading the current from the
machine.</p>

<p>If a loop of wire, Fig. 140, be so arranged on bearings
at its ends that it can be made
to revolve, a current will flow
through it in one direction
during one-half of the revolution,
and in the opposite direction
during the other half, it
being insulated from all external
conductors. This
agrees with the experiments
suggested in § 127, when the
current generated in a coil
passed in one direction during
its motion <i>toward</i> the strongest part of the field, and
in the opposite direction when the coil passed <i>out</i> of
it. A coil must be cut by lines of force to generate a
current. A current
inside of the machine,
as in Fig. 140, would
be of no value; it must
be led out to external
conductors where it
can do work. Some
sort of sliding contact
is necessary to connect
a revolving conductor
with outside stationary ones. The magnet, called the <i>field-magnet</i>,
is merely to furnish lines of magnetic force. The
one turn of wire represents the simplest form of <i>armature</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 141 shows the ends of a coil joined to two rings, X,
Y, insulated from each other, and rotating with the coil.
The two stationary pieces of carbon, A, B, called <i>brushes</i>,
press against the rings, and to these are joined wires,
which complete the circuit, and which lead out where the
current can do work. The arrows show the direction of
the current during one-half of a revolution. The rings
form a <i>collector</i>, and this arrangement gives an <i>alternating
current</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;">

</div>

<p>In Fig. 142 the ends of the coil are joined to the two
halves of a cylinder. These halves, X and Y, are insulated
from each other, and from the axis. The current
flows from X onto the brush A, through some external
circuit, to do the work, and thence back through brush
B onto Y. By the time that Y gets around to A, the
direction of the current in the loop has reversed, so that
it passes toward Y, but it still enters the outside circuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
through A, because Y is then in contact with A. This
device is called a <i>commutator</i>, and it allows a constant or
<i>direct current</i> to leave the machine.</p>

</div>

<p>In regular machines, the field-magnets are electromagnets,
the whole or a part of the current from the dynamo
passing around them on its way out, to excite them and
make a powerful field between the poles. To lessen the
resistance to the lines of force on their way from the N to
the S pole of the field-magnets, the armature coils are
wound on an iron core; this greatly increases the strength
of the field, as the lines of force have to jump across but
two small air-gaps. There are many loops of wire on
regular armatures, and many segments to the commutator,
carefully insulated from each other, each getting its
current from the coil attached to it.</p>

endless number of different makes and shapes of dynamos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
they may be divided into two great types; the <i>continuous</i>
or <i>direct current</i>, and the <i>alternating current</i> dynamo.
Direct current machines give out a current which constantly
flows in one direction, and this is because a commutator
is used. Alternating currents come from collectors
or rings, as shown in Fig. 141; and as an alternating
current cannot be used to excite the fields, an outside
current from a small direct current machine must be
used. These are called exciters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/i_107.jpg" width="339" height="246" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 149.</div>
</div>

<p>In direct current machines enough residual magnetism
is left in the field to induce a slight current in the armature
when the machine is started. This immediately
adds strength to the field-magnets, which, in turn, induce
a stronger current in the armature.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_131"></a>131. Winding of Dynamos.</b> There are several ways
of winding dynamos, depending upon the special uses to
be made of the current.</p>

<p>The <i>series wound</i> dynamo, Fig. 143, is so arranged that
the entire current passes around the field-magnet cores
on its way from the machine. In the <i>shunt wound</i> dynamo,
Fig. 144, a part, only, of the current from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
machine is carried around the field-magnet cores through
many turns of fine wire. The <i>compound wound</i> dynamo
is really a combination of the two methods just given.
In <i>separately-excited</i> dynamos, the current from a separate
machine is used to excite the field-magnets.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<small>HOW THE ELECTRIC CURRENT IS TRANSFORMED.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_133"></a>133. Electric Current and Work.</b> The amount of
work a current can do depends upon two factors; the
strength (amperes), and the pressure, or E. M. F. (volts).
A current of 10 amperes with a pressure of 1,000 volts =
10 × 1,000 = 10,000 watts. This furnishes the same
amount of energy as a current of 50 amperes at 200 volts;
50 × 200 = 10,000 watts.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_134"></a>134. Transmission of Currents.</b> It is often necessary
to carry a current a long distance before it is used.
A current of 50 amperes would need a copper conductor
25 times as large (sectional area) as one to carry the 10
ampere current mentioned in § 133. As copper conductors
are very expensive, electric light companies, etc.,
generally try to carry the current on as small a wire as
possible. To do this, the voltage is kept high, and the
amperage low. Thus, as seen in § 133, the current of
1,000 volts and 10 amperes could be carried on a much
smaller wire than the other current of equal energy. A
current of 1,000 volts, however, is not adapted for lights,
etc., so it has to be changed to lower voltage by some
form of transformer before it can be used.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_135"></a>135. Transformers</b>, like induction coils, are instruments
for changing the E. M. F. and strength of currents.
There is very little loss of energy in well-made
transformers. They consist of two coils of wire on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
core; in fact, an induction coil may be considered a transformer,
but in this a direct current has to be interrupted.
If the secondary coil has 100 times as many turns of wire
as the primary, a current of 100 volts can be taken from
the secondary coil when the primary current is but 1
volt; but the <i>strength</i> (amperes) of this new current will
be but one-hundredth that of the primary current.</p>

<p>By using the coil of fine wire as the primary, we can
lower the voltage and increase the strength in the same
proportion.</p>

<p>Fig. 150 shows about the simplest form of transformer
with a solid iron core, on which are wound two coils, the
one, P, being the primary, and the other, S, the secondary.
Fig. 151 shows the general appearance of one make of
transformer. The operation of this apparatus, as already
mentioned, is to reduce the high pressure alternating
current sent out over the conductors from the dynamo,
to a potential at which it can be employed with convenience
and safety, for illumination and other purposes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
They consist of two or more coils of wire most carefully
insulated from one another. A core or magnetic circuit
of soft iron, composed of very thin punchings, is then
formed around these coils, the purpose of the iron core
being to reduce the magnetic resistance and increase the
inductive effect. One set of these coils is connected with
the primary or high-pressure wires, while the other set,
which are called the secondary coils, is connected to the
house or low-pressure wires, or wherever the current is
required for use. The rapidly alternating current impulses
in the primary or high-pressure wires induce secondary
currents similar in form but opposite in direction
in the secondary coils. These current impulses are of a
much lower pressure, depending upon the ratio of the
number of turns of wire in the respective coils, it being
customary to wind transformers in such a manner as to
reduce from 1,000 or 2,000-volt primaries to 50 or 100-volt
secondaries, at which voltage the secondary current is
perfectly harmless.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_136"></a>136. Motor-Dynamos.</b> Fig. 152. These consist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
essentially of two belt-type machines on a common base,
direct coupled together, one machine acting as a motor to
receive current at a certain voltage, and the other acting
as a dynamo to give out the current usually at a different
voltage. As they transform current from one voltage to
another, motor-dynamos are sometimes called Double
Field Direct Current Transformers. The larger sizes
have three bearings, one bearing being between the two
machines, while the smaller sizes have but two bearings,
the two armatures being fastened to a common
spider.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 379px;">
<img src="images/i_112.jpg" width="379" height="293" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 153.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Applications.</i> The uses to which motor-dynamos are
put are very various. They are extensively used in the
larger sizes as "Boosters," for giving the necessary extra
force on long electric supply circuits to carry the current
to the end with the same pressure as that which reaches
the ends of the shorter circuits from the station.</p>

<p>Motor-dynamos have the advantage over dynamotors,
described later, of having the secondary voltage easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and economically varied over wide ranges by means of a
regulator in the dynamo field.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_137"></a>137. Dynamotors.</b> Fig. 153. In Dynamotors the
motor and dynamo armatures are combined in one, thus
requiring a single field only. The primary armature
winding, which operates as a motor to drive the machine,
and the secondary or dynamo winding, which operates as
a generator to produce a new current, are upon the same
armature core, so that the armature reaction of one winding
neutralizes that of the other. They therefore have
no tendency to spark, and do not require shifting of the
brushes with varying load. Having but one field and
two bearings, they are also more efficient than motor-dynamos.</p>

<p><i>Applications.</i> They have largely displaced batteries for
telegraph work. The size shown, occupying a space of
about 8-inch cube, and having an output of 40 watts, will
displace about 800 gravity cells, occupying a space of
about 10 feet cube. The cost of maintenance of such a
battery per year, exclusive of rent, is about $800, whereas
the 1-6 dynamotor can be operated at an annual expense
of $150.</p>

<p>Dynamotors are largely used by telephone companies
for charging storage batteries, and for transforming from
direct to alternating current, for ringing telephone bells.
Electro-cautery, electroplating, and electric heating also
give use to dynamotors.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_138"></a>138. Conductors and Insulators.</b> To carry the
powerful current from the generating station to distant
places where it is to give heat, power, or light, or even
to carry the small current of a single cell from one
room to another, <i>conductors</i> must be used. To keep the
current from passing into the earth before it reaches its
destination <i>insulators</i> must be used. The form of conductors
and insulators used will depend upon the current and
many other conditions. It should be remembered that
the current has to be carried to the lamp or motor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
through which it passes, and then back again to the
dynamo, to form a complete circuit. A break anywhere
in the circuit stops the current. Insulators are as important
as conductors.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_139"></a>139. Mains, Service Wires, etc.</b> From the switchboard
the current flows out through the streets in large
conductors, or <i>mains</i>,
the supply being kept
up by the dynamos,
just as water-pressure
is kept up by the constant
working of
pumps. Branches,
called <i>service wires</i>, are
led off from the mains to supply houses or factories, one
wire leading the current into the house from one main,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and a similar one leading it out of the house again to the
other main.</p>

out from the service

still other branches&mdash;<i>floor
mains</i>, <i>etc.</i>, that
pass through halls, etc.,
smaller branches finally

sizes of all of these wires depend upon how much current
has to pass through them. The mains in large cities are
usually placed underground. In some places they are
carried on poles.</p>

number of things are necessary. To measure the current
a meter is usually placed in the cellar. In new

some sort of tube which
acts as a double protection,
all being hidden
from view. Fig. 158

<p><b><a id="par_142"></a>142. Safety Devices.</b>
We have seen that when
too large a current passes
through a wire, the wire
becomes heated and may
even be melted. Buildings
are wired to use certain currents, and if from any cause
much more current than the regular amount should
suddenly pass through the service wires into the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the various smaller wires would become overheated, and
perhaps melt or start a fire. An accidental short circuit,
for example, would so reduce resistance that too much
current would suddenly rush through the wires. There
are several devices by which the over-heating of wires
is obviated.</p>

<p>Fig. 165 shows a <i>safety fuse</i>, or <i>safety cut-out</i>, which
consists of a short length of easily fusible wire, called
<i>fuse wire</i>, placed in the circuit and supported by a porcelain
block. These wires are tested, different sizes being
used for different currents. As soon as there is any tendency
toward over-heating, the fuse <i>blows</i>; that is, it
promptly melts and opens the circuit before any damage
can be done to the regular conductors. Fig. 166 shows
a cross-section of a <i>fuse plug</i> that can be screwed into an
ordinary socket. The fuse wire is shown black.</p>

<p>Fig. 167 shows a <i>fuse link</i>. These are also of fusible
material, and so made that they can be firmly held under
screw-heads. For heavy currents <i>fuse ribbons</i> are used,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
or several wires or links may be used side by side. Fig.
168 shows a <i>fusible rosette</i>. Fig. 169 shows two fuse
wires fixed between screw-heads, the current passing
through them in opposite directions,
both sides of the circuit being included.
Fig. 170 shows various
forms of cut-outs.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_143"></a>143. Wires and Cables</b> are made
in many sizes. Figs. 171 to 175 show
various ways of making small conductors.
They are made very flexible,
for some purposes, by twisting many small copper wires
together, the whole being then covered with insulating
material.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 274px;">

<p>Figs. 176, 177, show sections of submarine cables.
Such cables consist of copper conductors insulated with
pure gutta-percha. These are then surrounded by hempen
yarn or other elastic material,
and around the whole are
placed galvanized iron armor
wires for protection. Each
core, or conductor, contains a
conductor consisting of a
single copper wire or a strand
of three or more twisted
copper wires.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_144"></a>144. Lamp Circuits.</b> As
has been noted before, in
order to have the electric current do its work, we must
have a complete circuit. The current must be brought
back to the dynamo, much of it, of course, having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
used to produce light, heat, power, etc. For lighting
purposes this is accomplished in two principal ways.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/i_122a.jpg" width="420" height="153" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 178.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 178 shows a number of lamps so arranged, "in
series," that the same current passes through them all,
one after the other. The total resistance of the circuit
is large, as all of the lamp resistances are added together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">
<img src="images/i_122b.jpg" width="421" height="160" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 179.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 179 shows lamps arranged side by side, or "in
parallel," between the two main wires. The current
divides, a part going through each lamp that operates.
The total resistance of the circuit is not as large as in
the series arrangement, as the current has many small
paths in going from one main wire to the other. Fig. 179
also shows the ordinary <i>two-wire system</i> for incandescent
lighting, the two main wires having usually a difference
of potential equal to 50 or 110 volts. These comparatively
small pressures require fairly large conductors.</p>

<p><i>The Three-Wire System</i>, Fig. 180, uses the current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
from two dynamos, arranged with three main wires.
While the total voltage is 220, one of the wires being
neutral, 110 volts can be had for ordinary lamps. This
voltage saves in the cost of conductors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;">

</div>

<p><i>The Alternating System</i>, Fig. 181, uses transformers.
The high potential of the current allows small main wires,
from which branches can be run to the primary coil of
the transformer. The secondary coil sends out an induced
current of 50 or 110 volts, while that in the primary
may be 1,000 to 10,000 volts.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<small>HOW HEAT IS PRODUCED BY THE ELECTRIC CURRENT.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_145"></a>145. Resistance and Heat.</b> We have seen that all
wires and conductors offer resistance to the electric current.
The smaller the wire the greater its resistance.
Whenever resistance is offered to the current, heat is produced.
By proper appliances, the heat of resistance can
be used to advantage for many commercial enterprises.
Dynamos are used to
generate the current
for heating and lighting
purposes.</p>

<p>Fig. 182 shows how
the current from two
strong cells can be
used to heat a short
length of very fine
platinum or German-silver wire. The copper conductors
attached to the cells do not offer very much resistance.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that in all electrical work
the sizes of the wires used have to be such that they do
not overheat. The coils of dynamos, motors, transformers,
ampere-meters, etc., etc., become somewhat heated
by the currents passing through them, great care being
taken that they are properly designed and ventilated so
that they will not burn out.</p>

electric welding machine. The principle involved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the art of electric welding is that of causing currents of
electricity to pass through the abutting ends of the pieces
of metal which are to be welded,
thereby generating heat at the
point of contact, which also becomes
the point of greatest resistance,
while at the same time
mechanical pressure is applied to
force the parts together. As
the current heats the metal at

found possible to accomplish not only the common kinds
of welding of iron and steel, but also of metals which
have heretofore resisted attempts at welding, and have
had to be brazed or soldered.</p>

enormous currents to be so applied to the weld as to spend
their energy just at the point where heating is required.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
They need, therefore, only to be applied for a few seconds,
and the operation is completed before the heat generated
at the weld has had time to escape by conduction to any
other part.</p>

<p>Although the quantity of the current so employed in
the pieces to be welded is enormous, the potential at
which it is applied is extremely low, not much exceeding
that of the batteries of cells used for ringing electric bells
in houses.</p>

<small>HOW LIGHT IS PRODUCED BY THE INCANDESCENT
LAMP.</small></h2>

<p><b><a id="par_148"></a>148. Incandescence.</b> We have just seen that the
electric current produces heat
when it flows through a conductor
that offers considerable
resistance to it. As soon as
this was discovered men began
to experiment to find whether
a practical light could also be
produced. It was found that
a wire could be kept hot by
constantly passing a current
through it, and that the light
given out from it became
whiter and whiter as the wire became hotter. The wire
was said to be <i>incandescent</i>, or glowing with heat. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
metal wires are good conductors of electricity, they had
to be made extremely fine to offer enough resistance;
too fine, in fact, to be properly handled.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_149"></a>149. The Incandescent Lamp.</b> Many substances
were experimented upon to find a proper material out of
which could be made a <i>filament</i> that would
give the proper resistance and at the same
time be strong and lasting. It was found
that hair-like pieces of carbon offered the
proper resistance to the current. When
heated in the air, however, carbon burns; so
it became necessary to
place the carbon filaments
in a globe from
which all the air had
been pumped before
passing the current through them. This proved to be a
success.</p>

<p>Fig. 192 shows the ordinary form of lamp. The <i>carbon
filament</i> is attached, by carbon paste, to short platinum
wires that are sealed in the glass, their lower ends being
connected to short copper wires that are joined to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
terminals of the lamp. When the lamp is screwed into
its socket, the current can pass up one side of the filament
and down the other. The filaments used have been
made of every form of carbonized vegetable matter.
Bamboo has been largely used, fine strips being cut by
dies and then heated in air-tight boxes containing fine
carbon until they were thoroughly carbonized. This
baking of the bamboo produces a tough fiber of carbon.
Various forms of thread have been carbonized and used.
Filaments are now made by pressing finely pulverized
carbon, with a binding material, through small dies. The
filaments are made of such sizes and lengths that will
adapt them to the particular current with which they are
to be used. The longer the filament, the greater its
resistance, and the greater the voltage necessary to push
the current through it.</p>

<p>After the filaments are properly attached, the air is
pumped from the bulb or globe. This is done with some
form of mercury pump, and the air is so thoroughly removed
from the bulb that about one-millionth only of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
original air remains. Before sealing off the lamp, a current
is passed through the filament to drive out absorbed
air and gases, and these are carried
away by the pump. By proper treatment
the filaments have a uniform
resistance throughout, and glow uniformly
when the current passes.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_150"></a>150. Candle-Power.</b> A lamp is
said to have 4, 8, 16 or more candle-power.
A 16-candle-power lamp, for
example, means one that will give as
much light as sixteen standard
candles. A standard sperm candle
burns two grains a minute. The
candle-power of a lamp can be increased
by forcing a strong current
through it, but this shortens its life.</p>

<p><i>The Current</i> used for incandescent
lamps has to be strong enough to
force its way through the filament and
produce a heat sufficient to give a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
good light. The usual current has 50 or 110 volts,
although small lamps are made that can be run by two
or three cells. If the voltage of the current is less than
that for which the lamp was made, the light will be dim.
The filament can be instantly burned
out by passing a current of too high
pressure through it.</p>

<p>Even with the proper current,
lamps soon begin to deteriorate, as
small particles of carbon leave the
filament and cling to the glass.
This is due to the evaporation,
and it makes the filament smaller, and a higher pressure
is then needed to force the current through the increased
resistance; besides this, the darkened bulb does not properly
let the light out. The current may be direct or
alternating.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<small>HOW LIGHT IS PRODUCED BY THE ARC LAMP.</small></h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 292px;">
<img src="images/i_135.jpg" width="292" height="571" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 206.</div>
</div>
<p><b><a id="par_152"></a>152. The Electric Arc.</b> When a strong current
passes from one carbon rod to another across an air-space,
an <i>electric arc</i> is produced.
When the ends of
two carbon rods touch, a
current can pass from one
to the other, but the imperfect
contact causes resistance
enough to heat the
ends red-hot. If the rods
be separated slightly, the
current will continue to
flow, as the intensely heated
air and flying particles of
carbon reduce the resistance
of the air-space.</p>

<p>Fig. 206 shows two carbon
rods which are joined
to the two terminals of a
dynamo. The upper, or
positive, carbon gradually
wears away and becomes
slightly hollow. The
heated <i>crater</i>, as it is called, is the hottest part. The
negative carbon becomes pointed. The arc will pass in
a vacuum, and even under water.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>As the electric arc is extremely hot, metals are easily
vaporized in it; in fact, even the carbon rods themselves
slowly melt and vaporize. This extreme heat is used for
many industrial purposes.</p>

<p>"The phenomenon of the electric arc was first noticed by
Humphrey Davy in 1800, and its explanation
appears to be the following:
Before contact the difference of potential
between the points is insufficient
to permit a spark to leap across even
1/10000 of an inch of air-space, but when
the carbons are made to touch, a current is established.
On separating the carbons, the momentary extra current
due to self-induction of the circuit, which possesses a high
electromotive force, can leap the short distance, and in
doing so volatilizes a small quantity of carbon between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the points. Carbon vapor, being a partial conductor,
allows the current to continue to flow across the gap,
provided it be not too wide; but as
the carbon vapor has a very high resistance
it becomes intensely heated
by the passage of the current, and the
carbon points also grow hot. Since,
however, solid matter is a better
radiator than gaseous matter, the
carbon points emit far more light
than the arc itself, though they are
not so hot. It is observed, also, that
particles of carbon are torn away
from the + electrode, which becomes
hollowed out to a cup-shape, and
some of these are deposited on the - electrode."</p>

<p><b><a id="par_153"></a>153. Arc Lamps.</b> As the carbons gradually wear
away, some device is necessary to keep their ends the
right distance apart. If they
are too near, the arc is very
small; and if too far apart,
the current can not pass and
the light goes out. The
positive carbon gives the more
intense light and wears away
about twice as fast as the -
carbon, so it is placed above
the - carbon, to throw the
light downwards.</p>

<p>Arc lamps contain some device by which the proper
distance between the carbons can be kept. Most of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
grip the upper carbon and pull
it far enough above the lower
one to establish the arc. As
soon as the distance between
them gets too great again, the
grip on the upper carbon is
loosened, allowing the carbon to
drop until it comes in contact
with the lower one, thus starting
the current again. These
motions are accomplished by
electromagnets. Fig. 207 shows
a form of arc lamp with <i>single carbons</i> that will burn
from 7 to 9 hours.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_154"></a>154. Disruptive Discharges.</b> We have seen, in the
study of induction coils, that a spark can jump several
inches between the terminals of the secondary coil. The
attraction between the two oppositely charged terminals
gets so great that it overcomes the resistance of the air-space
between them, a brilliant spark passes, and they are
discharged. This sudden discharge is said to be <i>disruptive</i>,
and it is accompanied by a flash of light and a loud
report. The <i>path</i> of the discharge may be nearly straight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
or crooked, depending upon the nature of the material in
the gap between the terminals.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_155"></a>155. Effect of Air Pressure on Spark.</b> The disruptive
spark takes place in air at ordinary pressures.
The nature of the spark is greatly changed when the pressure
of the air decreases. Fig. 216 shows an air-tight glass
tube so arranged that the
air can be slowly removed
with an air-pump. The
upper rod shown can be
raised or lowered to increase
the distance between
it and the lower rod, these
acting as the terminals of
an induction coil. Before exhausting any air, the spark
will jump a small distance between the rods and act as
in open air. As soon as a small amount of air is removed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
a change takes place. The spark is not so intense
and has no definite path, there being a general
glow throughout the tube. As the air pressure becomes
still less, the glow becomes brighter, until the entire tube
is full of purple light that is able to pass the entire
length of it; that is, the discharge takes place better in
rarefied air than it does in ordinary air.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_156"></a>156. Vacuum-Tubes.</b> As electricity passes through
rarefied gases much easier than
through ordinary air, regular
tubes, called <i>vacuum-tubes</i>, are
made for such study. Fig. 217 shows a plain tube of
this kind, platinum terminals being fused in the glass
for connections. These tubes are often made in complicated
forms, Fig. 218, with colored glass, and are
called <i>Geissler tubes</i>. They are often made in such a
way that the electrodes are in the shape of discs, etc.,
and are called <i>Crookes tubes</i>, Fig. 219. A slight amount
of gas is left in the tubes.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_158"></a>158. X-Rays.</b> Professor Roentgen of Würzburg discovered
that when the cathode rays are allowed to fall
upon a solid body, the solid body gives out still other rays
which differ somewhat from the original cathode rays.
They can penetrate, more or less, through many bodies that
are usually considered opaque. The hand, for example,
may be used as a negative for producing a photograph of
the bones, as the rays do not pass equally well through
flesh and bone.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_159"></a>159. X-Ray Photographs.</b> Bone does not allow the
X-rays to pass through it as readily as flesh, so if the
hand be placed over a sensitized photographic plate, Fig.
221, and proper connections be made with the induction
coil, etc., the hand acts as a photographic negative.
Upon developing the plate, as in ordinary photography, a
picture or shadow of the bones will be seen. Fig. 222

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<small>THE ELECTRIC MOTOR, AND HOW IT DOES WORK.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_160"></a>160. Currents and Motion.</b> We have seen, Chapter
XII., that when coils of wire are rapidly moved across a
strong magnetic field, a current of electricity is generated.
We have now to deal with the opposite of this; that is,
we are to study how <i>motion</i> can be produced by allowing
a current of electricity to pass through the armature of a
machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. 224 shows, by diagram, a coil H, suspended so
that it can move easily, its ends being joined to a current
reverser, and this, in turn, to a dry cell D C. A
magnet, H M, will attract the core of H when no current
passes. When the current is allowed to pass first in one
direction and then in the opposite direction, by using the
reverser, the core of H will jump back and forth from one
pole of H M to the other. There are many ways by
which motion can be produced by the current, but to
have it practical, the motion must be a rotary one. (See
"Study," Chapter XXVI., for numerous experiments.)</p>

<p><b><a id="par_161"></a>161. The Electric Motor</b> is a machine for transforming
electric energy into mechanical power. The construction
of motors is very similar to that of dynamos. They
have field-magnets, armature coils, commutator, etc.; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
fact, the armature of an ordinary direct current dynamo
will revolve if a current be passed through it, entering by
one brush and leaving by the other. There are many
little differences of construction, for mechanical and electrical
reasons, but we may say that the general construction
of dynamos and motors is the same.</p>

<p>Fig. 225 shows a coil of wire, the ends of which are
connected to copper and zinc plates. These plates are
floated in dilute sulphuric acid, and form a simple cell
which sends a current through the wire, as shown by the
arrows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 481px;">
<a href="images/i_149-big.jpg"><img src="images/i_149.jpg" width="481" height="360" alt="drawing" /></a>
<div class="caption">Fig. 227.</div>
</div>

<p>We have seen that a current-carrying wire has a magnetic
field and acts like a magnet; so it will be easily seen
that if a magnet be held near the wire it will be either
attracted or repelled, the motion depending upon the
poles that come near each other. As shown in the figure,
the N pole of the magnet repels the field of the wire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
causing it to revolve. We see that this action is just the
reverse to that in galvanometers, where the coil is fixed,
and the magnet, or magnetic needle, is allowed to move.
As soon as the part of the
wire, marked A in Fig.
225, gets a little distance
from the pole, the opposite
side of the wire, B, begins
to be attracted by it, the
attraction getting stronger
and stronger, until it gets
opposite the N pole. If
the N pole were still held
in place, B would vibrate
back and forth a few times, and finally come to rest
near the pole. If, however, as soon as B gets opposite
N the S pole of the magnet be quickly turned toward
B, the coil will be repelled and the rotary motion will
continue.</p>

</div>

<p>Let us now see how this helps to explain electric motors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
We may consider the wire of Fig. 225 as one coil
of an armature, and the plates, C and Z, as the halves of
a commutator. In this arrangement, it must be noted,
the current always flows through the armature coil in the
same direction, the rotation
being kept up by reversing
the poles of the field-magnet.
In ordinary simple
motors the current is reversed
in the armature
coils, the field-magnets remaining
in one position
without changing the poles.
This produces the same effect as the above. The
current is reversed automatically as the brushes allow
the current to enter first one commutator bar and then
the opposite one as the armature revolves. The regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
armatures have many coils and many commutator bars,
as will be seen by examining the illustrations shown.</p>

<p>The ordinary galvanometer may be considered a form
of motor. By properly opening
and closing the circuit, the rotary
motion of the needle can be kept
up as long as current is supplied.
Even an electric bell or telegraph
sounder may be considered a
motor, giving motion straight forward
and back.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_162"></a>162. The Uses of Motors</b> are
many. It would be impossible to
mention all the things that are
done with the power from motors.
A few illustrations will give an
idea of the way motors are attached
to machines.</p>

<p>Fig. 226 shows one form of
motor, the parts being shown in
Fig. 227.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 221px;">
<img src="images/i_152.jpg" width="221" height="662" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 234.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 228 shows a fan motor run
by a battery. They are generally
run by the current from the street.
Figs. 229-231 show other forms of
fan motors. Fig. 232 shows an
electric hat polisher. A church
organ bellows is shown in Fig. 233, so arranged that it
can be pumped by an electric motor. Fig. 234 shows a
motor direct connected to a drill press.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_163"></a>163. Starting Boxes.</b> If too much current were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
suddenly allowed to pass into the armature of a motor,
the coils would be over-heated, and perhaps destroyed,
before it attained its full speed. A rapidly revolving
armature will take more current, without being overheated,
than one not in motion. A motor at full speed
acts like a dynamo, and generates a current which tends
to flow from the machine in a direction opposite to that
which produces the motion. It is evident, then, that
when the armature is at rest, all the current turned on
passes through it without meeting with this opposing
current.</p>

coils properly connected to contact-points at the

charged first through resistance, then direct,
and then the current is put on the armature gradually
through a series of coils, the amount of current depending
upon the distance the switch is turned. Fig. 236

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<small>ELECTRIC CARS, BOATS, AND AUTOMOBILES.</small></h2>


<p><b><a id="par_164"></a>164. Electric Cars</b>, as well as boats, automobiles, etc.,
etc., are moved by the power that comes from electric
motors, these receiving current from the dynamos placed
at some "central station." We have already seen how
the motor can do many kinds of work. By properly
gearing it to the car wheels, motion can be given to them
which will move the car.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 582px;">
<img src="images/i_154.jpg" width="582" height="242" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 237.</div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 237 shows two dynamos which will be supposed to
be at a power house and which send out a current to
propel cars. From the figure it will be seen that the
wires over the cars, called trolley-wires, are connected to
the positive (+) terminals of the dynamos, and that the
negative (-) terminals are connected to the tracks. In
case a wire were allowed to join the trolley-wire and
track, we should have a short circuit, and current would
not only rush back to the dynamo without doing useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
work, but it would probably injure the machines. When
some of the current is allowed to pass through a car,
motion is produced in the motors, as has been explained.
As the number of cars increases, more current passes back
to the dynamos, which must
do more work to furnish
such current.</p>

<p><i>Trolley-poles</i>, fastened to
the top of the cars and
which end in grooved
wheels, called <i>trolley-wheels</i>,
are pressed by springs
against the trolley-wires.
The current passes down
these through switches to
<i>controllers</i> at each end of
the car, one set being used
at a time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 289px;">
<img src="images/i_155a.jpg" width="289" height="593" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 238.</div>

<div class="caption">Fig. 239.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_165"></a>165. The Controllers</b>, as the name suggests, control
the speed of the car by allowing more or less current to
pass through the motors. The motors, resistance coils
and controllers are so connected with each other that
the amount of current used can be regulated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 477px;">
<img src="images/i_156a.jpg" width="477" height="246" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 240.</div>
</div>

<p>When the motorman turns the handle of the controller
to the first notch, the current passes through all of the
resistance wires placed under the car, then through one
motor after the other. The motors being joined in
series by the proper connections at the controller, the
greatest resistance is offered to the current and the car
runs at the slowest speed at this first notch. As more
resistance is cut out by turning the handle to other
notches, the car increases
its speed; but
as the resistance wires
become heated and the
heat passes into the
air, there is a loss of
energy. It is not
economical to run a
car at such a speed
that energy is wasted
as heat. As soon as
the resistance is all cut out, the current simply passes
through the motors joined in series. This gives a fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
slow speed and one that is economical because all the
current tends to produce motion.</p>

<p>By allowing the current to pass through the motors
joined in parallel, that is, by allowing each to take a part
of the current, the resistance is greatly reduced, and a
higher speed attained. This is not instantly done, however,
as too much strain would be put upon the motors.
As soon as the next notch is reached, the motors are
joined in parallel and the resistance also thrown in again.
By turning the handle still more, resistance is gradually
cut out, and the highest speed produced when the current
passes only through the motors in parallel.</p>

wires for furnishing current are placed over the tracks, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in Fig. 237, we have the overhead system. In cities the
underground system is largely used. The location of the
conducting wires beneath the surface of the street removes
all danger to the public, and protects them from all interference,
leaving the street free from poles and wires.</p>

<p>Fig. 240 shows a cross-section of an underground conduit.
The rails, R R, are supported by cast-iron yokes, A,
placed five feet apart, and thoroughly imbedded in concrete.
The conduit has sewer connections every 100 feet.
Conducting bars, C C, are placed on each side of the conduit,
and these are divided into sections of about 500
feet. Insulators, D D, are placed every 15 feet. They
are attached to, and directly under, the slot-rails, the
stem passing through the conductor bar.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 140px;">

<p>Figs. 240 and 241 show the plow E. The contact
plates are carried on coiled springs to allow a free motion.

The conducting wires are carried up through the leg of
the plow.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_167"></a>167. Appliances.</b> A large number of articles are
needed in the construction of electric railroads. A few,

<p><b><a id="par_168"></a>168. Electric Boats</b> are run by the current from
storage batteries which are usually placed under the
seats. An electric motor large enough to run a small
boat takes up very little room and is generally placed
under the floor. This leaves the entire boat for the use
of passengers. The motor is connected to the shaft that
turns the screw. Fig. 247 shows one design.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 227px;">

</div>
<p><b><a id="par_169"></a>169. Electric Automobiles</b> represent the highest type
of electrical and mechanical construction. The <i>running-gear</i>
is usually made of the best cold-drawn seamless
steel tubing, to get the greatest strength from a given
weight of material. The wheels are made in a variety
of styles, but nearly all have ball bearings and pneumatic
tires. In the lightest styles the wheels have wire spokes.</p>

<p>The <i>electric motors</i>, supported by the running-gear, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
geared to the rear wheels. The motors are made as
nearly dust-proof as possible.</p>

<img src="images/i_160.jpg" width="533" height="264" alt="drawing long boat" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 247.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Storage batteries</i> are put in a convenient place, depending
upon the design of the carriage, and from these the
motors receive the current. These can be charged from
the ordinary 110-volt lighting circuits or from private
dynamos. The proper plugs and attachments are usually
furnished by the various makers for connecting the
batteries with the street current, which is shut off when
the batteries are full by an automatic switch.</p>

<p><i>Controllers</i> are used, as on electric cars, the lever for
starting, stopping, etc., being usually placed on the left-hand
side of the seat. The <i>steering</i> is done by a lever
that moves the front wheels. Strong brakes, and the
ability to quickly reverse the motors, allow electric carriages
to be stopped suddenly in case of accidents.</p>

<p>Electric automobiles are largely used in cities, or where
the current can be easily had. The batteries must be
re-charged after they have run the motors for a certain
time which depends upon the speed and road, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
upon the construction. Where carriages are to be run
almost constantly, as is the case with those used for general
passenger service in cities, duplicate batteries are necessary,
so that one or two sets can be charged while another
is in use. Fig. 248 shows one form of electric vehicle,
the storage batteries being placed under and back of the
seat.</p>

<small>A WORD ABOUT CENTRAL STATIONS.</small></h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 143px;">
<img src="images/i_162.jpg" width="143" height="505" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 249.</div>
</div>

<p><b><a id="par_170"></a>170. Central Stations</b>, as the word implies, are places
where, for example, electricity is generated for the incandescent
or arc lights used in a certain neighborhood;
where telephone or telegraph messages
are sent to be resent to some other station;
where operators are kept to switch different
lines together, so that those on
one line can talk to those on another,
etc., etc. There are many kinds of central
stations, each requiring a large
amount of special apparatus to carry on
the work. Fig. 249 gives a hint in
regard to the way car lines get their
power from a central power station.
As a large part of the apparatus required
in ordinary central stations has already
been described, it is not necessary to go
into the details of such stations.</p>


<p>In lighting stations, for example, we
have three principal kinds of apparatus.
Boilers produce the steam that runs the
steam engines, and these run the dynamos
that give the current. Besides these there are many
other things needed. The electrical energy that goes over
the wires to furnish light, heat, and power, really comes
indirectly from the coal that is used to boil water and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
convert it into steam. The various parts of the central
station merely aid in this transformation of energy.</p>

<p>The dynamos are connected to the engines by belts, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
they are direct connected. Figs. 250, 251, show dynamos
connected to engines without belts.</p>

<p>The current from the dynamos is led to large switchboards
which contain switches, voltmeters, ammeters,
lightning arresters, and various other apparatus for the
proper control and measurement of the current. From
the switchboard it is allowed to pass through the various
street mains, from which it is finally led to lamps, motors,
etc.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig. 251.</div>
</div>

<p>Water-power is frequently used to drive the dynamos
instead of steam engines. The water turns some form of
water-wheel which is connected to the dynamos. At
Niagara Falls, for example, immense quantities of current
are generated for light, heat, power, and industrial purposes.</p>

<p>Fig. 254 shows another form of call box, the handle
being moved around to the call desired. As it springs
back to the original position, an interrupted current
passes through the box to the central station, causing a
bell to tap a certain number of times, giving the call and
location of the box.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_174"></a>174. Electric Gas-Lighters.</b> Fig. 255 shows a
<i>ratchet burner</i>. The first pull of the chain turns on the
gas through a four-way gas-cock, governed by a ratchet-wheel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and pawl. The issuing gas is lighted by a wipe-spark
at the tip of the burner. Alternate pulls shut off
the gas. As the lever brings the attached wire A, in contact
with the wire B, a bright spark passes, which ignites
the gas, the burner being joined with a battery and induction
or spark coil.</p>

<p><i>Automatic burners</i> are used when it is desired to light
gas at a distance from the push-button. Fig. 256 shows
one form. Two electromagnets are shown, one being
generally joined to a white push-button for turning on
the gas and lighting it, the other being joined to a black
button which turns off the gas when it is pressed. The
armatures of the magnets work the gas-valve. Sparks
ignite the gas, as explained above.</p>

<p><b><a id="par_177"></a>177. Annunciators</b> of various
kinds are used in hotels, factories,
etc., to indicate a certain room
when a bell rings at the office.
The bell indicates that some one
has called, and the annunciator
shows the location of the call by
displaying the number of the room
or its location. Fig. 259 shows a
small annunciator. They contain
electromagnets which are connected to push-buttons
located in the building, and which bring the numbers
into place as soon as the current passes through them.</p>

<p>This book explains, in simple, straightforward language, many
things about electricity; things in which the American boy is intensely
interested; things he wants to know; things he should
know.</p>

<p>It is free from technical language and rhetorical frills, but it
tells how things work, and why they work.</p>

<p>It is brimful of illustrations&mdash;the best that can be had&mdash;illustrations
that are taken directly from apparatus and machinery,
and that show what they are intended to show.</p>

<p>This book does not contain experiments, or tell how to make
apparatus; our other books do that. After explaining the simple
principles of electricity, it shows how these principles are used
and combined to make electricity do every-day work.</p>

<div class='adtitle2'>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />How Two Boys Made Their Own<br />
Electrical Apparatus.</div>


<blockquote>

<p>Containing complete directions for making all kinds of simple
electrical apparatus for the study of elementary electricity. By
<span class="smcap">Professor Thomas M. St. John</span>, New York City.</p>

<p>The book measures 5 × 7½ in., and is beautifully bound in
cloth. It contains 141 pages and 125 illustrations. Complete
directions are given for making 152 different pieces of Apparatus
for the practical use of students, teachers, and others who wish
to experiment.</p></blockquote>

<div class='center'>
<b><big>PRICE, POST-PAID, $1.00.</big></b><br />
</div>

<p>The shocking coils, telegraph instruments, batteries, electromagnets,
motors, etc., etc., are so simple in construction that any
boy of average ability can make them; in fact, the illustrations
have been made directly from apparatus constructed by young boys.</p>

<p>The author has been working along this line for several years, and
he has been able, <i>with the help of boys</i>, to devise a complete line of
simple electrical apparatus.</p>


<blockquote>

<p><b><i>THE APPARATUS IS SIMPLE because the designs and
methods of construction have been worked out practically
in the school-room, absolutely no machine-work
being required.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>THE APPARATUS IS PRACTICAL because it has been
designed for real use in the experimental study of
elementary electricity.</i></b></p>

<p><b><i>THE APPARATUS IS CHEAP because most of the parts
can be made of old tin cans and cracker boxes, bolts,
screws, wires and wood.</i></b></p></blockquote>

<p>"The author of this book is a teacher and wirier of great ingenuity,
and we imagine that the effect of such a book as this falling into juvenile
hands must be highly stimulating and beneficial. It is full of explicit
details and instructions in regard to a great variety of apparatus, and the
materials required are all within the compass of very modest pocket-money.
Moreover, it is systematic and entirely without rhetorical frills,
so that the student can go right along without being diverted from good
helpful work that will lead him to build useful apparatus and make him
understand what he is about. The drawings are plain and excellent. We
heartily commend the book."&mdash;<i>Electrical Engineer.</i></p>


<p>"Those who visited the electrical exhibition last May cannot have
failed to notice on the south gallery a very interesting exhibit, consisting,
as it did, of electrical apparatus made by boys. The various devices there
shown, comprising electro-magnets, telegraph keys and sounders, resistance
coils, etc., were turned out by boys following the instructions given
in the book with the above title, which is unquestionably one of the most
practical little works yet written that treat of similar subjects, for with
but a limited amount of mechanical knowledge, and by closely following
the instructions given, almost any electrical device may be made at very
small expense. That such a book fills a long-felt want may be inferred
from the number of inquiries we are constantly receiving from persons
desiring to make their own induction coils and other apparatus."&mdash;<i>Electricity.</i></p>


<p>"At the electrical show in New York last May one of the most interesting
exhibits was that of simple electrical apparatus made by the boys
in one of the private schools in the city. This apparatus, made by boys of
thirteen to fifteen years of age, was from designs by the author of this
clever little book, and it was remarkable to see what an ingenious use had
been made of old tin tomato-cans, cracker-boxes, bolts, screws, wire, and
wood. With these simple materials telegraph instruments, coils, buzzers,
current detectors, motors, switches, armatures, and an almost endless
variety of apparatus were made, In this book Mr. St. John has given
directions in simple language for making and using these devices, and has
illustrated these directions with admirable diagrams and cuts. The little
volume is unique, and will prove exceedingly helpful to those of our
young readers who are fortunate enough to possess themselves of a copy.
For schools where a course of elementary science is taught, no better text-book
in the first-steps in electricity is obtainable."&mdash;<i>The Great Round
World.</i></p>

<p>Children like to do experiments; and in this way, better than in
any other, <i>a practical knowledge of the elements of magnetism</i> may be
obtained.</p>

<p>These experiments, although arranged to <i>amuse</i> boys and girls,
have been found to be very <i>useful in the class-room</i> to supplement
the ordinary exercises given in text-books of science.</p>

<p>To secure the <i>best possible quality of apparatus</i>, the horseshoe
magnets were made at Sheffield, England, especially for these sets.
They are new and strong. Other parts of the apparatus have also
been selected and made with great care, to adapt them particularly
to these experiments.&mdash;<i>From the author's preface.</i></p>

The book contains 220 pages and 168 illustrations;<br />
it measures 5 × 7½ in. and is bound in green cloth.<br />
<br />
<b>PRICE, POST-PAID, $1.25.</b><br />
</div>

<p>This book is designed as a text-book for amateurs,
students, and others who wish to take up a systematic
course of elementary electrical experiments at home or in
school. Full directions are given for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class='center'>
<b><big><i>Two Hundred Simple Experiments.</i></big></b><br />
</div>
<p>The experiments are discussed by the author, after the
student has been led to form his own opinion about the
results obtained and the points learned.</p>

<p>In selecting the apparatus for the experiments in this
book, the author has kept constantly in mind the fact
that the average student will not buy the expensive
pieces usually described in text-books.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The two hundred experiments given can be performed with
simple apparatus; in fact, the student should make at least a part
of his own apparatus, and for the benefit of those who wish to do
this, the author has given, throughout the work, explanations
that will aid in the construction of certain pieces especially
adapted to these experiments. For those who have the author's
"How Two Boys Made Their Own Electrical Apparatus," constant
references have been made to it as the "Apparatus Book,"
as this contains full details for making almost all kinds of simple
apparatus needed in "The Study of Elementary Electricity and
Magnetism by Experiment."</p></blockquote>

<div class='adtitle3'><span class="u">Fun With Telegraphy</span></div>
<div class='center'><b><big>BOOK AND COMPLETE OUTFIT.</big></b></div>

</div>

<p><b>TELEGRAPHY</b> is of the greatest importance to all civilized nations, and
upon it depend some of the world's most important enterprises. Every boy
and girl can make practical use of telegraphy in one way or another, and the
time it takes to learn it will be well spent.</p>


<p><b>THE OUTFIT.</b>&mdash;Mr. St. John has worked for a number of years to produce a
telegraph outfit that would be simple, cheap, and practical for those who wish
to make a study of telegraphy. After making and experimenting with nearly
one hundred models, many of which were good, he has at last perfected an
instrument so simple, original, and effective that it is now being made in large
quantities.</p>

<p>The sounders are so designed that they will work properly with any dry cell
of ordinary strength, and this is a great advantage for practice lines. Dry
batteries are cheap and clean, and there are no dangers from acids.</p>

<p>The outfit consists of the following articles, placed in a neat box: One Book
of Instruction, called "Fun With Telegraphy"; one Telegraph "Key"; one
Telegraph "Sounder"; Insulated Copper Wires for connections. The "key"
and "sounder" are mounted, with proper "binding-posts," upon a base of
peculiar construction, which aids in giving a large volume of sound.</p>


<p><b>CONTENTS OF BOOK.</b>&mdash;Telegraphy.&mdash;The Outfit.&mdash;A Complete Telegraph
Line.&mdash;Connections.&mdash;The Telegraph Key.&mdash;The Sounder.&mdash;The Battery.&mdash;A
Practice Line.&mdash;A Two-instrument Line.&mdash;Operation of Line.&mdash;The Morse Telegraph
Alphabet.&mdash;Aids to Learning Alphabet.&mdash;Cautions.&mdash;Office Calls.&mdash;Receiving
Messages.&mdash;Remember.&mdash;Extra Parts.</p>


<p><b>ABOUT BATTERIES.</b>&mdash;For those who cannot easily secure batteries, we
will furnish small dry cells, post-paid, at 15 cents each, in order to deliver the
outfits complete to our customers. This price barely covers the total cost to
us, postage alone being 6 cents.</p>

<div class='adtitle2'>REAL ELECTRIC TOY-MAKING<br />
FOR BOYS</div>


<div class='center'><br />
<b><big><i>By</i> THOMAS M. ST. JOHN, Met. E.</big></b><br />
<br />
<br />
This book contains 140 pages and over one hundred<br />
original drawings, diagrams, and full-page plates.<br />
It measures 5 x 7½ in., and is bound in cloth.<br />
<br />
<b>Price, post-paid, $1.00</b><br />

<p><b>CONTENTS:</b> <i>Chapter</i> I. Toys Operated by Permanent

Electromagnets for Toys.&mdash;IV. Electric Batteries.&mdash;V. Circuits
and Connections.&mdash;VI. Toys Operated by Electromagnets.

Materials.&mdash;XVIII. Various Aids to Construction.</p>

<p>While planning this book, Mr. St. John definitely decided that
he would not fill it with descriptions of complicated, machine-made
instruments and apparatus, under the name of "Toy-Making,"
for it is just as impossible for most boys to get the
parts for such things as it is for them to do the required machine
work even after they have the raw materials.</p>

<p>Great care has been taken in designing the toys which are
described in this book, in order to make them so simple that
any boy of average ability can construct them out of ordinary
materials. The author can personally guarantee the designs,
for there is no guesswork about them. Every toy was made,
changed, and experimented with until it was as simple as possible;
the drawings were then made from the perfected models.</p>

<p>As the result of the enormous amount of work and experimenting
which were required to originate and perfect so many new
models, the author feels that this book may be truly called
"Real Electric Toy-Making for Boys."</p>

<div class='center'><big><i><b>SHOOTING BY ELECTRICITY</b></i></big><br />
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</div>

<p><b>The Electric Shooting Game</b> is an entirely new
idea, and one that brings into use that most mysterious
something&mdash;<i>electricity</i>. The game is so simple that small
children can play it, and as there are no batteries, acids,
or liquids of any kind, there is absolutely no danger.
The electricity is of such a nature that it is perfectly
harmless&mdash;but very active.</p>

<p>The "<i>game-preserve</i>" is neat and attractive, being
printed in colors, and the birds and animals are well
worth hunting. Each has a fixed value&mdash;and some of
them must not be shot at all&mdash;so there is ample opportunity
for a display of skill in bringing down those which
count most.</p>

<p>"<i>Electric bullets</i>" are actually shot from the "<i>electric
gun</i>" by electricity. This instructive game will furnish
a vast amount of amusement to all.</p>


<div class='hang1'><i><b>The "Game-Preserve,"&mdash;the "Electric Gun,"&mdash;the "Shooting-Box,"&mdash;the
